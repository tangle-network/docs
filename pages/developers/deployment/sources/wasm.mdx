# WebAssembly Sources

The `WASM` (WebAssembly) source is used for blueprints that are built as WASM binaries and intended to be executed in
a WASM runtime such as [Wasmtime].

## Requirements

The requirements for running WASM blueprints are available [here](/operators/manager/requirements#wasm-sources)

## Format

The `WASM` source has the following format:

```rust
pub struct WasmSource {
    pub runtime: WasmRuntime,
    pub fetcher: NativeSource,
}
```

Where:

- `runtime` - The WASM runtime this blueprint is intended to execute in (see [WasmRuntime])
- `fetcher` - The GitHub release information, identical to [NativeSource]

And they can be specified in the manifest of your binary crate like so:

```toml
[package.metadata.blueprint]
sources = [
    { type = "Wasm", runtime = "Wasmtime", fetcher = { owner = "some-github-user", repo = "some-blueprint", tag = "0.1.0", binaries = [
        { arch = "Wasm", os = "Unknown", name = "my-blueprint-bin" },
    ] } },
]
```
