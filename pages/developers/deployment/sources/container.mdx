# Container Source

The `Container` source is used for blueprints that are intended to be built as container images and published to image
registries, such as `docker.io`.

## Requirements

The requirements for running containerized blueprints are available [here](/operators/manager/requirements#container-sources)

## Format

The `Container` source has the following format:

```rust
pub struct ContainerSource {
    pub registry: String,
    pub image: String,
    pub tag: String,
}
```

Where:

- `registry` - The registry to pull the image from (ex. `docker.io`)
- `image` - The name of the image (ex. `some-user/my-blueprint`)
- `tag` - The release tag of the image (ex. `latest`)

And they can be specified in the manifest of your binary crate like so:

```toml
[package.metadata.blueprint]
sources = [
    { type = "Container", registry = "docker.io", image = "some-user/my-blueprint", tag = "latest" }
]
```
