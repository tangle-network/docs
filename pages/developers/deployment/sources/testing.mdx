# Testing Source

The `Testing` source is a special, automatically generated source that was historically used by the [Blueprint Manager]
during integration tests. It has since been replaced with the [test harnesses](/developers/testing/introduction).

## Format

The `Testing` source has the following format:

```rust
pub struct TestingSource {
    pub cargo_package: String,
    pub cargo_bin: String,
    pub base_path: String,
}
```

Where:

* `cargo_package` - The Cargo package name of the binary (ex. `my-blueprint-bin`)
* `cargo_bin` - The name of the built binary file (ex. `my-blueprint-bin`)
* `base_path` - The base path of the binary crate (ex. `/home/user/my-blueprint/bin`)

And they can be specified in the manifest of your binary crate like so:

```toml
[package.metadata.blueprint]
sources = [
    { type = "Testing", cargo_package = "some-package-name", cargo_bin = "some-binary", base_path = "/home/user/some-blueprint/bin" }
]
```

## Output

After building your blueprint, you'll notice something like the following in your `blueprint.json`:

```json
{
  // ...
  "sources": [
    {
      "type": "Testing",
      "cargo_package": "my-blueprint-bin",
      "cargo_bin": "my-blueprint-bin",
      "base_path": "/home/user/my-blueprint/bin"
    }
  ],
}
```

It can safely be ignored (or deleted if you prefer).
