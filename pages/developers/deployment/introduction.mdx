# Deploying Blueprints

In order for a blueprint to be instance-able, it'll need to be deployed and have one or more sources defined.

## Defining Sources

Before deploying, you must specify the sources from which to fetch the blueprint binaries.
See [Sources](/developers/deployment/sources/introduction).

## Deploying via the CLI

Once you're ready to deploy your blueprint, simply:

Install the [cargo-tangle] CLI, if you haven't already.

For testing, you can deploy to a local devnet:

```shell
export SIGNER="//Alice"
export EVM_SIGNER="0xcb6df9de1efca7a3998a8ead4e02159d5fa99c3e0d4fd6432667390bb4726854"
cargo tangle blueprint deploy tangle --devnet
```

See [deploy command reference](/developers/cli/tangle#deploying-a-blueprint) for all options.
