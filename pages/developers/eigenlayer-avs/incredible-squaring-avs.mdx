# Incredible Squaring AVS Example

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through building an EigenLayer AVS (Actively Validated Service) using Tangle Blueprints, using examples from the
[Incredible Squaring blueprint implementation](https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint/tree/main/examples/incredible-squaring-eigenlayer).

The Incredible Squaring AVS is a simple example that demonstrates how to build an AVS that squares numbers. While the computation is trivial, the example showcases the key components of an EigenLayer AVS built with Tangle Blueprints.

## Blueprint Structure

The Incredible Squaring AVS blueprint follows the basic library and binary structure:

1. **Library**: Contains job definitions and core logic
2. **Binary**: Contains the Blueprint Runner implementation

## Job Definitions

Jobs are the core computational units in your Blueprint. For the Incredible Squaring AVS, we define jobs to handle various tasks:

  fromLine={13}
  toLine={46}
  title="Initialize Task Job Definition"
/>

This job initializes a new task in the Incredible Squaring AVS. It takes parameters from an EVM event and processes them.

  fromLine={21}
  toLine={109}
  title="Compute X Square Job Definition"
/>

This job computes the square of a number in the Incredible Squaring AVS and sends the result as a signed response to an Aggregator.

## Working with EVM Smart Contracts

To interact with EVM smart contracts, the blueprint uses the `alloy` crate

  toLine={41}

## Blueprint Runner Architecture

The Blueprint Runner is the core component that orchestrates the execution of your Blueprint. For the Incredible Squaring AVS, it consists of several key components:

### 1. Setting Up the Provider

First, create an HTTP provider to connect to the Ethereum network with a wallet enabled for transacting:

  fromLine={32}
  toLine={36}
  title="Provider Setup"
/>

### 2. Creating Contexts

Next, create the contexts that will be used by your jobs:

  fromLine={39}
  toLine={43}
  title="Context Creation"
/>

### 3. Setting Up Producers

Producers listen for events and prepare them for processing. In the Incredible Squaring AVS, we set up producers to listen for EVM events:

<GithubFileReaderDisplay

  fromLine={63}
  toLine={69}
  title="Producer Setup"
/>

### 4. Configuring the Blueprint Runner

Finally, set up the Blueprint Runner with the router, producers, consumers, and background services:

<GithubFileReaderDisplay
  url="https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint/blob/d47f974b008712787982366a7ff1945d67e0035f/examples/incredible-squaring-eigenlayer/src/main.rs"
  fromLine={72}
  toLine={86}
  title="BlueprintRunner Setup"
/>

The Blueprint Runner:
- Uses a router to direct job calls to the appropriate handlers
- Sets up a producer that listen for events and prepare them for processing
- Our job automatically handles signed task responses, so we don't use a consumer
- Configures Aggregator as background services

## Testing the Incredible Squaring AVS

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Anvil
- Docker (DockerDesktop)

### 2. Installation

Clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint.git
cd blueprint
```

Install Anvil:

```shell
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 3. Running the AVS on a Testnet

We have a test for running this AVS Blueprint on a local Anvil Testnet. You can run the test with the following:

```shell
cargo test --package incredible-squaring-blueprint-eigenlayer test_eigenlayer_incredible_squaring_blueprint
```

## Best Practices and Considerations

1. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your job functions to manage potential failures gracefully.
2. **Asynchronous Operations**: Use `async/await` for operations that may take time, such as network requests or complex computations.
3. **State Management**: If your AVS needs to maintain state between job executions, consider implementing a state management system.
4. **Testing**: Implement unit tests for your job logic and integration tests for the complete AVS.
5. **Logging**: Use appropriate logging to track the job execution process and aid in debugging.
6. **Gas Considerations**: Be aware of the gas costs associated with your on-chain interactions, especially when responding to events with transactions.
7. **Scalability**: Design your AVS to scale with the number of tasks you expect to process.
8. **Security**: Ensure your AVS follows security best practices, especially when handling cryptographic operations.
