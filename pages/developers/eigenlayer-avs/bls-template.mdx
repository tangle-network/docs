# Building AVS with the EigenLayer BLS Template

## Introduction

This will guide you through the process of utilizing our BLS Template for starting your own AVS with BLS-oriented Smart
Contracts. The [Incredible Squaring AVS](/developers/eigenlayer-avs/incredible-squaring-avs) is an example of an AVS
that uses BLS contracts.

## Generating your project with Cargo Tangle

### 1. Installation

```shell
$ cargo install cargo-tangle --git https://github.com/tangle-network/gadget --force
```

### 2. Generating your Project

To create a new BLS AVS, use the following command:

```shell
$ cargo tangle blueprint create --name <blueprint_name> --eigenlayer
```

Just replace `<blueprint_name>` with the desired name for your AVS. Once you run this command, you will be asked a series
of questions regarding the configurations and setup for your project. Simply answer those questions when prompted; if
you aren't sure about a question, you likely just want the default selection that it starts on.

#### Note

If Soldeer fails to update/install the necessary dependencies upon generation, you may need to run it manually with the following command:

```bash
$ forge soldeer update -d
```

### 4. Hello, World!

Now that you have generated the project, you can test out the simple example by running:

```shell
$ cargo test
```

This test just shows that the template generates you a fresh, working AVS structure. All that's left is to add what you want!

### 5. Customizing your AVS

What you do from here is completely up to you, but we have plenty of resources to help you:

- The contracts generated with this template will be called TangleServiceManager.sol, TangleTaskManager.sol, and
  ITangleTaskManager.sol by default. You can use the find-and-replace function to change these to whatever you would like.
- Examples of different types of event listeners can be found [here](/developers/blueprint-event-listeners/introduction).
- A deeper dive into how jobs work can be found in the [jobs section](/developers/blueprint-macros/jobs).
