# Building AVS with the EigenLayer ECDSA Template

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of utilizing our ECDSA Template to initiate your own AVS with
ECDSA-oriented Smart Contracts. For reference, the [Tangle AVS](https://github.com/tangle-network/avs) demonstrates an
implementation of an AVS using ECDSA contracts.

## Generating your project with Cargo Tangle

### 1. Installation

Before proceeding, ensure you have cargo-tangle installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:

    > Supported on Linux, MacOS, and Windows (WSL2)

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/tangle-network/gadget/releases/download/cargo-tangle/v0.1.1-beta.7/cargo-tangle-installer.sh | sh
```

Alternatively, if you prefer installing the CLI from source:

```shell
cargo install cargo-tangle --git https://github.com/tangle-network/gadget --force
```

### 2. Generating your Project

To generate your project, execute the following command:

```shell
cargo tangle blueprint create --name <blueprint_name> --eigenlayer ecdsa
```

Replace `<blueprint_name>` with your preferred AVS name. Upon running this command, you'll be prompted with a
series of questions regarding your project's configuration and setup. Answer these questions as they appear; if
uncertain, the default selection is generally best.

#### Note

If you choose to use `foundry.toml` for the Soldeer configuration (the default), you will need to delete the following
files from the `contracts` directory:
- `foundry.toml`
- `remappings.txt`
- `soldeer.lock`

This step allows the generated project to correctly populate dependencies and build out of the box. We plan to address
this in future updates to eliminate the need for manual file deletion.

### 4. Hello, World!

Now that you have generated the project, you can test out the simple example by running:

```shell
cargo test
```

This test just shows that the template generates you a fresh, working AVS structure. All that's left is to add what you want!

### 5. Customizing your AVS

The next steps depend on your specific requirements, but we offer several resources to assist you:

- By default, the AVS contract generated with this template is named TangleServiceManager.sol (along with related test
files TestTangleServiceManager.sol and TangleServiceManager.t.sol). You can use your text editor's find-and-replace
function to rename these as desired.
