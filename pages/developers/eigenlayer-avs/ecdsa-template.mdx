# Building AVS with the EigenLayer ECDSA Template

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of utilizing our ECDSA Template to initiate your own AVS with
ECDSA-oriented Smart Contracts. For reference, the [Tangle AVS](https://github.com/tangle-network/avs) demonstrates an
implementation of an AVS using ECDSA contracts.

## Generating your project with Cargo Tangle

### 1. Installation

```shell
$ cargo install cargo-tangle --git https://github.com/tangle-network/gadget --force
```

### 2. Generating your Project

To generate your project, execute the following command:

```shell
$ cargo tangle blueprint create --name <blueprint_name> --eigenlayer ecdsa
```

Replace `<blueprint_name>` with your preferred AVS name. Upon running this command, you'll be prompted with a
series of questions regarding your project's configuration and setup. Answer these questions as they appear; if
uncertain, the default selection is generally best.

#### Note

If Soldeer fails to update/install the necessary dependencies upon generation, you may need to run it manually with the following command:

```bash
$ forge soldeer update -d
```

### 4. Hello, World!

Now that you have generated the project, you can test out the simple example by running:

```shell
$ cargo test
```

This test just shows that the template generates you a fresh, working AVS structure. All that's left is to add what you want!

### 5. Customizing your AVS

The next steps depend on your specific requirements, but we offer several resources to assist you:

- By default, the AVS contract generated with this template is named TangleServiceManager.sol (along with related test
  files TestTangleServiceManager.sol and TangleServiceManager.t.sol). You can use your text editor's find-and-replace
  function to rename these as desired.
