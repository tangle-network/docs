# Precompiles on Tangle Network

## Introduction to Precompiles

On Tangle Network, a precompiled contract refers to native Substrate code that possesses an Ethereum-like address and can be engaged through the Ethereum API, as with any other smart contract. These precompiles enable you to directly interact with the Substrate runtime, a functionality that is usually inaccessible from the Ethereum aspect of Tangle Network.

The Substrate code that oversees the implementation of precompiles is located within the EVM pallet. This EVM pallet comprises the standard precompiles existing on Ethereum along with some other precompiles that aren't unique to Ethereum. It further offers the capacity to form and execute custom precompiles through the versatile Precompiles trait. A range of custom Tangle Network-specific precompiles have been developed and can be found within the Tangle Network codebase.

The Ethereum precompiled contracts encompass complex functions that require substantial computational resources, including hashing and encryption. On Tangle Network, the custom precompiled contracts allow access to Substrate-based features such as staking, governance, XCM-related operations, and more.

These Tangle Network-specific precompiles can be accessed through familiar and user-friendly Solidity interfaces utilizing the Ethereum API, which ultimately interact with the underlying Substrate interface.
