## Tangle Network: Use Cases

Tangle Network enables various use cases, primarily focusing on enhancing privacy and improving cross-chain interoperability. Here are some key proposed applications:

### 1. Signing as a Service (TSSaaS)

Tangle provides signatures as a service using threshold cryptography, with validators participating in multi-party distributed key generation protocols to create keys for threshold signing. This enables the development of secure and decentralized:

- **Custody Solutions**: By requiring multiple custodians to authorize transactions jointly, TSS enhances asset security and provides flexible key management and recovery.

- **Oracles**: TSS enables a decentralized approach to handling oracle data, ensuring data accuracy and resilience to collusion by requiring consensus among signers.

- **Cross-Chain Bridges**: TSS boosts the security and reliability of cross-chain bridges by decentralizing signing authority, increasing resistance to attacks and collusion.

### 2. Interoperable Shielded Pools

The Tangle Network is ideal for maintaining the state of bridged shielded pools, enabling the creation of cross-chain private transaction systems. The Webb Protocol Anchor System provides an architecture for implementing various private bridge protocols, such as:

- **Multi-Asset Shielded Bridges**: The Variable Multi-Asset Anchor System enables users to transfer arbitrary amounts of different assets privately between blockchains using zero-knowledge proofs.

- **Identity-Based Variable Asset Anchor System**: By combining an identity protocol with the Variable Multi-Asset protocol, a cross-chain shielded pool application can be designed for a restricted identity set, enabling compliance or community-based private transaction systems.

### 3. Social and Identity Bridges

Tangle's infrastructure supports cross-chain social and identity bridges, enabling content and membership-based applications with customizable zero-knowledge proofs of membership:

- **Interoperable Membership Groups / Semaphores**: An extension of the Semaphore protocol to a cross-chain identity set, allowing members of NFT communities to register and interact privately across chains.

- **Interoperable Badge System**: Using expressive data blobs for proofs of ownership, participation, and identity, enabling composable application development with zero-knowledge and private data disclosure.

### 4. Expansion and Integration of MPC Capabilities

Tangle Network's MPC infrastructure can be expanded and integrated with various cryptographic protocols to enhance its capabilities:

- **New Threshold Signature Schemes**: Integrating schemes like ECDSA, Schnorr, BLS, and FROST to enhance security by distributing signature generation across multiple parties.

- **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**: Integrating FHE with MPC to enable secure and private computation on encrypted data across multiple parties.

- **Randomness Beacons**: Incorporating randomness beacons, like those from the League of Entropy, to enhance security and fairness in various cryptographic protocols.

- **Federated Learning Protocols**: Securely computing AI and ML models on distributed data without exposing the underlying data, enabling privacy-preserving data analysis and model training.

- **Threshold Encryption Protocols**: Integrating protocols that distribute encryption and decryption among multiple parties, enhancing data security.

- **General MPC Compiler Infrastructure**: Developing a general MPC compiler infrastructure to simplify the process of creating secure multi-party applications.
