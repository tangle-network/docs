# Building EVM Event Listeners for EigenLayer AVS

## Introduction

This will guide you through setting up and using EVM event listeners for EigenLayer AVSes, using examples from the
[Incredible Squaring blueprint implementation](https://github.com/tangle-network/gadget/tree/main/blueprints/incredible-squaring-eigenlayer).

EVM event listeners are crucial for interacting with smart contracts on Ethereum-compatible networks.
In the context of EigenLayer and the blueprint macro system, these listeners allow your Gadget to respond to specific
events emitted by EigenLayer contracts.

## Setting Up EVM Event Listeners

### 1. Contract Definition

First, define the contract interface using the `sol!` and `load_abi!` macros. This generates Rust bindings for your smart contract.

### 2. Job Definition with Event Handler

Use the [`#[job]`](./blueprint-macros/jobs.mdx) macro to define a function that will handle specific events. Include the `event_listener` attribute to specify the event details:

  fromLine={13}
  toLine={52}

/>

### 3. Event Converter Preprocessor Function

Implement a preprocessor function to convert the event data into the format expected by your job function:

  fromLine={54}
  toLine={67}

/>

## Implementing the Event Listener

### 1. Set Up the Provider

Create an HTTP provider to connect to the Ethereum network w/ a wallet enabled for transacting:

  fromLine={21}
  toLine={25}
  title="Provider setup"
/>

### 2. Create the Contract Instances and Event Listeners

Instantiate the contract using the generated bindings:

<GithubFileReaderDisplay

  fromLine={37}
  toLine={52}
  title="Contract creation and event listener setup"
/>

### 3. Set up the BlueprintRunner

Use the `BlueprintRunner` to execute the jobs and background services:

<GithubFileReaderDisplay

  fromLine={54}
  toLine={61}

/>

## Best Practices and Considerations

1. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your event listener functions to manage potential failures gracefully.
2. **Asynchronous Operations**: Use `async/await` for operations that may take time, such as network requests or complex computations.
3. **Event Filtering**: Consider implementing additional filtering logic in your event converter function if you need to process only specific events based on certain criteria.
4. **State Management**: If your Gadget needs to maintain state between events, consider implementing a state management system.
5. **Testing**: Implement unit tests for your event handling logic, including the event converter function.
6. **Logging**: Use appropriate logging to track the event handling process and aid in debugging.
7. **Gas Considerations**: Be aware of the gas costs associated with your on-chain interactions, especially when responding to events with transactions.
8. **Scalability**: Design your event handling system to scale with the number of events you expect to process.
