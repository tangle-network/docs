title: Context and Context Extensions in Gadget SDK

## What is a `Context`?

In the Gadget SDK, a `Context` simply holds any a job may have, that aren't direct inputs.

A Context can include various elements such as:

- HTTP clients for making network requests
- Database connections for data persistence
- Loggers for recording application events
- Configuration objects for environment-specific settings
- Authentication tokens or credentials
- Caches or in-memory data stores

The Context pattern is closely related to the Dependency Injection (DI) design pattern, which is a technique for achieving Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies.

for more information on dependency injection, see:

- [dependency injection principles, practices, and patterns](https://www.manning.com/books/dependency-injection-principles-practices-patterns)
- [martin fowler's article on dependency injection](https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html)

## Why do we need a `Context`?

The Context pattern offers several significant benefits in software design and development:

1. Decoupling: By passing dependencies through a Context, we decouple the job implementation from the specific implementations of its dependencies. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.

2. Testability: With a Context, it's easier to mock or stub dependencies during unit testing, allowing for more comprehensive and isolated tests.

3. Flexibility: Contexts allow for easy swapping of implementations, which is particularly useful when adapting to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

4. Separation of Concerns: The Context pattern helps separate the configuration and setup of dependencies from their usage, leading to cleaner, more focused code.

5. Reusability: Jobs that rely on a Context can be more easily reused in different scenarios by simply providing a different Context.

### Example: "Is it down for everyone or just me?" Service

Let's examine an example of a blueprint similar to the "Down for Everyone or Just Me!" service. This example demonstrates how a Context can be used to provide an HTTP client to a job.

```rust
// Define the Context struct with an HTTP client
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Context {
    http_client: reqwest::Client,
}

impl Context {
    // Constructor for creating a new Context
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            http_client: reqwest::Client::new(),
        }
    }

    // Getter method for accessing the HTTP client
    fn http_client(&self) -> &reqwest::Client {
        &self.http_client
    }
}

/// Job to check if a website is down for everyone or just you.
#[job(id = 1, params(url), result(_))]
pub async fn down_for_everyone_or_just_me(
    ctx: &Context,  // The Context is passed as a parameter
    url: String,
) -> Result<String, reqwest::Error> {
    // Access the HTTP client from the Context
    let client = ctx.http_client();
    // Make a GET request to the specified URL
    let response = client.get(&url).send().await?;
    let status = response.status();
    // Return a message based on the HTTP status code
    Ok(match status {
        reqwest::StatusCode::OK => format!("It's just you! {url} looks up from here."),
        _ => format!("It's not just you! {url} looks down from here."),
    })
}
```

In this example, the `Context` struct encapsulates an HTTP client, which is then used by the `down_for_everyone_or_just_me` job. This design allows for easy testing and potential replacement of the HTTP client implementation without changing the job's code.

## What is a Context Extension?

A Context Extension is a powerful feature in the Gadget SDK that allows you to add functionality to a Context without modifying its original structure. It's essentially a trait that can be implemented for your Context, providing additional methods and capabilities.

Context Extensions offer several advantages:

1. Modularity: You can add new functionality without changing existing code.
2. Separation of Concerns: Different aspects of the Context can be defined and implemented separately.
3. Reusability: Extensions can be shared across different Context types.
4. Flexibility: You can choose which extensions to implement based on your needs.

- [The Rust Programming Language: Traits: Defining Shared Behavior](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html)

### Built-in Context Extensions

The Gadget SDK provides several built-in Context Extensions that offer common functionality:

1. `KeystoreContext`: Provides access to the [GenericKeyStore](https://docs.rs/gadget-sdk/latest/gadget_sdk/keystore/backend/enum.GenericKeyStore.html), useful for managing cryptographic keys and secrets.
2. `EVMProviderContext`: Offers access to the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) Provider, which is an RPC Client for interacting with EVM-compatible blockchains.
3. `TangleClientContext`: Provides access to the Tangle Client (Subxt), used for interacting with the Tangle network.
4. `ServicesContext`: Allows access to the current Service instance properties, useful for service-specific operations.

for more documentation about the built-in extensions, please refer to the [API Documentation](https://docs.rs/gadget-sdk/latest/gadget_sdk/ctx/index.html).

These extensions can be easily added to your Context using derive macros, as shown in the following example.

### Example: Using the `KeystoreContext` Extension

Here's an example of how to use the built-in `KeystoreContext` extension:

```rust
use std::convert::Infallible;
use gadget_sdk::ctx::KeystoreContext;
use gadget_sdk::config::StdGadgetConfiguration;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, KeystoreContext)] // Derive the KeystoreContext extension
struct Context {
    http_client: reqwest::Client,
    #[config]
    sdk_config: StdGadgetConfiguration,
}

#[job(id = 2, params(x), result(_))]
pub fn x_squared(ctx: &Context, x: u64) -> Result<u64, Infallible> {
    let keystore = ctx.keystore(); // Access the keystore using the extension method
    // Use the keystore here ...
    let x_squared = x.pow(2);
    Ok(x_squared)
}
```

By deriving `KeystoreContext`, we add the `keystore()` method to our `Context`, allowing easy access to the `GenericKeyStore`. This pattern can be applied to other built-in extensions as well.

## How to create a custom Context Extension?

Context Extensions are just Rust traits that can be implemented for your Context struct. Here is an example of how you can create a custom Context Extension:

1. Define the goal of the extension and the methods it should provide.
2. Create a new trait with the required methods.
3. Create a derive macro to automatically implement the trait for your Context struct (optional).
4. Implement the trait for your Context struct, providing the required methods.

## Creating a Custom Context Extension

Creating a custom Context Extension involves the following steps:

1. Define the extension's purpose and required methods.
2. Create a new trait with these methods.
3. (Optional) Create a derive macro for automatic trait implementation.
4. Implement the trait for your Context struct.

Here's an improved example of a custom `HttpClientContext` extension:

```rust
use reqwest::Client;

// Define the HttpClientContext trait
pub trait HttpClientContext {
    fn http_client(&self) -> Client;
}

// Implement the trait for our Context
impl HttpClientContext for Context {
    fn http_client(&self) -> Client {
        self.http_client.clone()
    }
}

// Example job using the custom extension
#[job(id = 3, params(url), result(_))]
pub async fn fetch_url(ctx: &Context, url: String) -> Result<String, reqwest::Error> {
    let client = ctx.http_client();
    let response = client.get(&url).send().await?;
    let body = response.text().await?;
    Ok(body)
}
```

## Summary and Conclusion

In this guide, we've explored the concepts of Context and Context Extensions in the Gadget SDK:

1. We learned that a Context encapsulates dependencies and environmental setup for jobs.
2. We saw how Contexts promote decoupling, testability, and reusability in code.
3. We examined built-in Context Extensions provided by the Gadget SDK.
4. We created a custom Context Extension to add new functionality.

These patterns are fundamental to writing maintainable, testable, and flexible blueprints in the Gadget SDK ecosystem.
