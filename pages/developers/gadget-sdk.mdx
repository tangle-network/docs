# Gadget SDK

The Blueprint Gadget SDK is a powerful toolkit designed to streamline the development of offchain components for Actively Validated Services (AVS) and Tangle Blueprints. It provides a comprehensive set of features and tools that make building complex multi-party services faster, easier, and more secure.
