# Tangle CLI Quickstart

## Pre-requisites

- [git](https://git-scm.org)
- Tangle CLI, see [installation](./installation.mdx)

## Creating a New Tangle Blueprint

1. For an in-depth guide to commands, see the [Tangle Blueprint Commands](./tangle.mdx). If you are
   looking to get started building an Eigenlayer AVS, see the [eigenlayer section](./eigenlayer.mdx) instead.
   To get started right away with creating a Tangle Blueprint, open your terminal and run:

```shell
cargo tangle blueprint create --name <blueprint-name>
```

2. Follow the prompts to set up your project. The following image shows the prompt flow with example input and defaults selected.

cargo tangle blueprint deploy tangle --devnet
```
