# Blueprint Specification

## Overview

Blueprints are a standard for creating and deploying technical service configurations on the Tangle Network Marketplace. They enable developers to customize and monetize their offerings while ensuring economic security through stake recursion. Blueprints define the features, behavior, requirements, and staking parameters of a service, and can be discovered, deployed, and managed by consumers on the marketplace.
Blueprints are deployed to a network of incentivized operators who provide the specified service. The platform's economic security is maintained through the stake recursion process, involving delegators and nominators. Blueprints can be composed and linked together to create complex, interactive applications that leverage the Tangle Network's decentralized infrastructure.

## Detail

### For Developers

Blueprints allow developers to create, customize, and monetize technical service configurations on the Tangle Network Marketplace. Developers define the features, behavior, resource requirements, and gadget binary of their services, such as Threshold Signing Schemes. They can specify staking parameters to ensure economic security and incentivize operator participation. Unlike traditional one-off deployments, Tangle blueprints are designed for multiple uses by different users and projects.

### For Consumers

Tangle Network provides a user-friendly platform for consumers to discover, deploy, and manage Blueprints. Consumers can access tailored technical services with varying configurations and features, specify their requirements (e.g., threshold of participants, registration criteria), and select a subset of operators to provide the service. The stake recursion process ensures the economic security and reliability of these services.

### For Operators

Operators are incentivized to provide the services specified in the Blueprints to consumers through a reward system funded by the staking and recursion process, which is governed by TNT holders who decide which blueprints receive incentives based on their value to the network. Operators play a vital role in maintaining the decentralized infrastructure and ensuring the availability and performance of the services offered.

### For Delegators and Nominators

Delegators and nominators contribute to the economic security of the Tangle Network Marketplace by providing liquidity through the stake recursion process. They earn rewards based on their participation and the network's overall performance. The inflation and reward distribution mechanism incentivizes both developers and restakers, with a portion of the inflationary rewards directed to developers who create attractive services that attract liquidity from restakers.

### Composability

Blueprints can be composed and linked together to create sophisticated, interoperable applications, fostering innovation and collaboration within the Tangle ecosystem. The Tangle architecture is uniquely suited for complex cryptographic applications, such as multi-party computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) services, as well as oracles, custody solutions, bridge co-processors, and proving networks. Developers are encouraged to collaborate and contribute to expanding the library of apps and services on Tangle, and will be rewarded with incentives for their valuable contributions.
