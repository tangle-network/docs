# Blueprint Specification

## Overview

Blueprints are a standard for creating and deploying technical service configurations on the Tangle Network Marketplace, enabling developers to customize and monetize their offerings while ensuring the economic security of these services through stake recursion.

A Blueprint is a set of metadata and parameters that define the features and behavior of a technical service, such as a Threshold Signing Scheme.

These blueprints can be discovered, deployed, and managed by consumers on the Tangle Network Marketplace.

Blueprints are deployed to a network of operators who provide the specified service in exchange for incentives. The economic security of the platform is maintained through the liquidity provided by delegators and nominators, who participate in the stake recursion process.

Blueprints include essential information such as the service type, configuration settings, and resource requirements. They can also specify the staking parameters that ensure economic security and incentivize operator participation.

Blueprints can be composed and linked together to create complex, interactive applications that leverage the power of the Tangle Network's decentralized infrastructure.

## Detail

### For Developers

Blueprints are a standard for creating and deploying technical service configurations on the Tangle Network Marketplace. They enable developers to customize and monetize their offerings by defining the features, behavior, and resource requirements of their services, such as Threshold Signing Schemes. Developers can specify staking parameters to ensure the economic security of their services and incentivize operator participation.

### For Consumers

Consumers can discover, deploy, and manage Blueprints on the Tangle Network Marketplace. By browsing and selecting Blueprints, consumers can access a wide range of technical services with varying configurations and features. The Tangle Network Marketplace ensures the economic security of these services through stake recursion, providing consumers with a reliable and trustworthy platform for deploying and managing their chosen Blueprints.

### For Operators

Operators are responsible for providing the services specified in the Blueprints to consumers on the Tangle Network Marketplace. They are incentivized to run these services through a reward system, which is funded by the staking and recursion process. Operators play a crucial role in maintaining the decentralized infrastructure of the Tangle Network and ensuring the availability and performance of the services offered through Blueprints.

### For Delegators and Nominators

Delegators and nominators contribute to the economic security of the Tangle Network Marketplace by providing liquidity through the stake recursion process. By participating in staking, they help to secure the network and ensure the reliability of the services offered through Blueprints. In return, delegators and nominators can earn rewards based on their level of participation and the overall performance of the network.

### Composability

Blueprints can be composed and linked together to create complex, interactive applications that leverage the power of the Tangle Network's decentralized infrastructure. This composability enables developers to build sophisticated services and applications by combining multiple Blueprints, while consumers benefit from access to a wide range of customizable and interoperable solutions.
