# Getting Started with Tangle Blueprints

Welcome to the Tangle Blueprint tutorial! This guide will walk you through creating a simple `Hello World` Blueprint for Tangle. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a basic understanding of how to create, build, and deploy a Tangle Blueprint.

## What are Tangle Blueprints?

Tangle Blueprints are specifications for Actively Validated Services (AVS) on the Tangle Network. An AVS is an off-chain service that runs arbitrary computations for a user-specified period of time. Blueprints provide a useful abstraction, allowing developers to create reusable service infrastructures similar to smart contracts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Forge](https://getfoundry.sh)
- [Tangle](https://github.com/tangle-network/tangle?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started-)
- [`cargo-tangle`](./cli/installation.mdx) CLI tool

## Creating my First Blueprint

See the [CLI Quickstart](./cli/quickstart.mdx) for instructions on creating a [blueprint](./blueprints/introduction.mdx).

### Key Files

#### src/lib.rs

This file contains the core logic of your Blueprint, including job definitions, report structures, and event listeners. Here's an example of a simple "Hello World" job:

1. **Jobs**: Define the main computational tasks of your Blueprint. For more details on creating jobs, see our [Blueprint Job Documentation](/developers/blueprint-macros/jobs).

2. **Reports**: Define offchain reporting logic for the custom slashing functionality of your Blueprint. Learn more about reports in our [Blueprint Report Documentation](/developers/blueprint-macros/reports).

3. **Event Listeners**: Set up listeners to react to on-chain events, offchain events, cron-job like listeners, and even custom event triggers. For a deep dive into event listeners, check out our [Event Listener Documentation](/developers/blueprint-event-listeners/introduction).

Here's a basic example incorporating these elements:

<GithubFileReaderDisplay
  url="https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint-template/blob/main/src/lib.rs"
  fromLine={20}
  toLine={36}
  title="Example Blueprint Job with Tangle JobCalled Event Listener"
/>

This job takes an optional `who` parameter and returns a greeting.

#### src/main.rs

This file serves as the entry point for your Actively Validated Service (AVS) node. It sets up the runtime environment, initializes the necessary components, and starts the event watcher. Here's a breakdown of its key responsibilities:

1. **Environment Setup**: It loads the configuration, initializes the logger, and sets up error handling.
2. **Client Initialization**: It creates a connection to the Tangle Network using the provided RPC endpoint.
3. **Registration**: It checks if the node should run registration (implementation pending).
4. **Event Handler Creation**: It instantiates the event handler for the `say_hello` job.
5. **Event Watcher**: It starts the Substrate event watcher, which listens for relevant events on the Tangle Network.

<GithubFileReaderDisplay
  url="https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint-template/blob/main/src/main.rs"
  fromLine={6}
  toLine={27}
  title="Example Blueprint `main.rs` Entry Point"
/>

This sets up the AVS node, initializes the environment, and starts the event watcher.

## Building Your Project

To build your project, run:

```bash
cargo build
```

This command compiles your Rust code and checks for any errors.

### Deploying Your Blueprint

See [deploying your blueprint](./cli/quickstart.mdx#deploying-your-blueprint).

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've created, built, and deployed your first Tangle Blueprint. Here are some suggestions for what to do next:

1. Explore more complex job implementations in your `lib.rs` file. Learn more about [Jobs and the Job Macro system](/developers/blueprint-macros/jobs).

2. Implement reporting mechanisms using the [Reports Macro](/developers/blueprint-macros/reports) to ensure the integrity of your AVS.

3. Dive deeper into [Event Listeners](/developers/blueprint-event-listeners/introduction) to understand how to trigger your jobs and reports based on various events.

4. Learn about [Context and Context Extensions](/developers/blueprint-macros/context) to manage dependencies and state in your Blueprint.

5. If you're interested in building for EigenLayer, check out our guide on [Building an EigenLayer AVS](/developers/eigenlayer-avs).

6. Implement tests for your Blueprint using `tokio::test`. Learn more about [Testing Blueprints](/developers/blueprint-macros/testing).

7. Explore the Tangle network's features and how they interact with your Blueprint. Understand [EVM and Native Addresses](/developers/technicals/addresses) and [EVM to Substrate transfers](/developers/technicals/evm-substrate-transfers).

8. Familiarize yourself with [EVM Precompiles](/developers/technicals/precompiles) available on Tangle Network.

9. Learn about [Deploying Contracts with Hardhat](/developers/technicals/deploy-using-hardhat) for more advanced contract deployment scenarios.
