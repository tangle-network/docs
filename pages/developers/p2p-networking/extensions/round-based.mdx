# `round-based` extension for P2P Networking

[round-based] is an MPC framework that unifies and simplifies the way of developing and working with multiparty
protocols (e.g. threshold signing, random beacons, etc.).

To enable the extension, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
blueprint-sdk = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["round-based-compat", ...]}
```

The extension provides multiple wrappers, with the primary one being the [`RoundBasedNetworkAdapter`].
