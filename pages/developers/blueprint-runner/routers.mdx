# Routers

Routers are a critical component of the [Blueprint Runner](/developers/blueprint-runner/introduction) architecture. They are responsible for directing job calls to the appropriate job handlers based on job IDs. This document explains how routers work, how to configure them, and best practices for implementation.

## What are Routers?

In a Blueprint Runner, a router acts as a traffic director for job execution. When a job is called, the router:

1. Identifies the correct handler for the job based on the job ID
2. Validates the job parameters
3. Passes the parameters to the job handler
4. Returns the result to the consumer

Routers ensure that jobs are executed by the appropriate handlers, making them essential for the proper functioning of your Blueprint Runner.

## Router Configuration

Routers are configured when building the Blueprint Runner in the `main.rs` file of your Blueprint's binary. The configuration involves:

1. Creating a new router
2. Defining routes for each job you have, mapping a job ID to each job in it's route
3. Setting a context for the router, which will contain any resources needed by the jobs

### Basic Router Setup

A simple router setup might look like this, assuming you have already created a job and context:

```rust
use blueprint_sdk::runner::BlueprintRunner;
use blueprint_sdk::Router;

let router = Router::builder()
    .route(MY_JOB_ID, my_job)
    .with_context(my_context);
```

## Layers

Layers are used to filter job calls based on certain criteria. There are two places layers can be used:

1. A specific Route:
    - A job can be given a layer. This can be seen in the above code example, where the job is in the `TangleLayer`. This allows the consumer, which operates in that layer, to see the results from that job. This simplifies your Blueprint when you have many jobs, routes, and consumers.
2. A whole Router:
    - A layer can be used to filter job calls based on some criteria. This can also be seen in the above code example, where the router is given a filter for the service ID. This allows the router to only process jobs with a matching service ID.

## Integration with Other Components

Routers work closely with other Blueprint Runner components:

- **Producers**: [Producers](/developers/blueprint-runner/producers) pass job calls to the router for processing
- **Consumers**: The router passes job results to [Consumers](/developers/blueprint-runner/consumers) for handling

## Conclusion

Routers are a fundamental component of Blueprint Runners, enabling efficient job execution and management. By properly configuring and utilizing routers, you can build robust and performant Blueprints and AVSs.
