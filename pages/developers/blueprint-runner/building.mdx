# Building a Blueprint Runner

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to building a Blueprint Runner, the primary component of a Blueprint.

## Prerequisites

Before you start building your Blueprint Runner, ensure you have:

1. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed
2. [Tangle CLI](../cli/installation.mdx) installed
3. A basic understanding of [Blueprints](../blueprints/introduction.mdx)
4. A Blueprint created with the CLI as seen in [Step 1](#step-1-setting-up-the-project-structure) below

## Blueprint Runner Structure

A Blueprint Runner consists of:

1. **Entry Point**: The runner is the primary component in a blueprint's `main.rs`
2. **[Jobs](/developers/blueprint-runner/jobs) Configuration**: Build the jobs that will be executed
3. **[Router](/developers/blueprint-runner/routers) Configuration**: Setup for directing job calls to the jobs themselves for handling
4. **[Producer](/developers/blueprint-runner/producers) Configuration**: Setup for the source of events (e.g. blockchain, external APIs)
5. **[Consumer](/developers/blueprint-runner/consumers) Configuration**: Setup for the handling of results from jobs
6. **[Background Service](/developers/blueprint-runner/background-services) Configuration**: Setup for supporting services (e.g. databases, servers, etc.)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up the Project Structure

If you haven't already created a Blueprint project, you can use the Tangle CLI (if you haven't installed it yet, see [here](../cli/installation.mdx)):

```bash
cargo tangle blueprint create --name <BLUEPRINT_NAME>
```

This creates a workspace with two main packages:

- **Library Package**: Contains your job definitions and core logic
- **Binary Package**: Contains your Blueprint Runner implementation

### Step 2: Defining Your Jobs

Before building the runner, define the jobs that your Blueprint will execute. Jobs are defined in the library package:

  fromLine={7}
  toLine={21}
  title="Job Definition from our Incredible Squaring Example"
/>

For more details on defining jobs, see the [Jobs documentation](/developers/blueprint-runner/jobs).

### Step 3: Creating a Producer and a Consumer

To build a Blueprint Runner, you need a producer to listen for events and a consumer to handle the results from jobs.

<GithubFileReaderDisplay
  url="https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint/blob/a9860d2e3a161af63a75d6d800f662d303e92e5b/examples/incredible-squaring/incredible-squaring-bin/src/main.rs"
  fromLine={28}
  toLine={31}
  title="Creating a Producer and a Consumer"
/>

### Step 4: Configuring the Router

The [router](/developers/blueprint-runner/routers) directs job calls to the appropriate handlers. In the example below, we configure the router with a single route for our defined job and specify that it is on Tangle with the `TangleLayer`:

<GithubFileReaderDisplay
  url="https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint/blob/a9860d2e3a161af63a75d6d800f662d303e92e5b/examples/incredible-squaring/incredible-squaring-bin/src/main.rs"
  fromLine={33}
  toLine={48}
  title="Configuring the Router"
/>

This configuration:

1. Creates a new router
2. Adds a route for the `square` job with ID `XSQUARE_JOB_ID`
3. Applies the `TangleLayer` to add metadata to job results
4. Adds a filter layer to only process jobs that match the service ID

For more details on routers, see the [Routers documentation](/developers/blueprint-runner/routers).

### Step 5: Defining a Background Service

Some blueprints may require one or more services to run in the background. Any number of background services can be set to run for a Blueprint Runner.

<GithubFileReaderDisplay
  url="https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint/blob/a9860d2e3a161af63a75d6d800f662d303e92e5b/examples/incredible-squaring/incredible-squaring-lib/src/lib.rs"
  fromLine={23}
  toLine={34}
  title="Defining a Background Service"
/>

With a background service defined, it just needs to be added to the Blueprint Runner:

  fromLine={36}
  toLine={49}
  title="Adding a Background Service to the Blueprint Runner"
/>

### Step 6: Configuring a Producer with the Blueprint Runner's Builder

[Producers](/developers/blueprint-runner/producers) listen for events and prepare them for processing. The following example uses a `TangleProducer` as seen in [Step 3](#step-3-creating-a-producer-and-a-consumer):

<GithubFileReaderDisplay
  url="https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint/blob/a9860d2e3a161af63a75d6d800f662d303e92e5b/examples/incredible-squaring/incredible-squaring-bin/src/main.rs"
  fromLine={36}
  toLine={54}
  title="Adding a Producer to the Blueprint Runner"
/>

This producer listens for finalized blocks on the Tangle network and converts them into job calls that can be processed by the router.

For more details on producers, see the [Producers documentation](/developers/blueprint-runner/producers).

### Step 7: Configuring a Consumer with the Blueprint Runner's Builder

[Consumers](/developers/blueprint-runner/consumers) handle the results of processed jobs. In the example above, we set up a Tangle consumer as seen in [Step 3](#step-3-creating-a-producer-and-a-consumer):

<GithubFileReaderDisplay
  url="https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint/blob/a9860d2e3a161af63a75d6d800f662d303e92e5b/examples/incredible-squaring/incredible-squaring-bin/src/main.rs"
  fromLine={36}
  toLine={60}
  title="Adding a Consumer to the Blueprint Runner"
/>

This consumer processes job results and can send transactions to the Tangle network based on those results.

For more details on consumers, see the [Consumers documentation](/developers/blueprint-runner/consumers).

### Step 8: Custom Shutdown Logic

Implement customized shutdown logic to handle cleanup and resource release:

<GithubFileReaderDisplay
  url="https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint/blob/a9860d2e3a161af63a75d6d800f662d303e92e5b/examples/incredible-squaring/incredible-squaring-bin/src/main.rs"
  fromLine={36}
  toLine={65}
  title="Custom Shutdown Logic"
/>

The above example simply prints a message when the Blueprint Runner is shutting down.

### Step 9: Running the Blueprint Runner

Finally, we run the Blueprint Runner:

```rust
// Build and run the Blueprint Runner
let result = BlueprintRunner::builder(tangle_config, env)
    // ... configuration ...
    .run()
    .await;
```

The `run` method starts the Blueprint Runner and returns a result indicating whether it ran successfully or encountered an error.

With this, the Blueprint Runner, the centerpoint of your Blueprint is ready to be used!
