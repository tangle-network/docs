# Interacting with the Batch Precompile

## Introduction

The batch precompiled contract on Tangle allows developers to combine multiple EVM calls into one.

Normally, having users interact with multiple contracts would require multiple transaction confirmations in the user's wallet. An example would be approving a smart contract's access to a token, then transferring it. With the batch precompile, developers can enhance user experience with batched transactions as it minimizes the number of transactions a user is required to confirm to one. Additionally, gas fees can be reduced since batching avoids multiple base gas fees (the initial 21000 units of gas spent to begin a transaction).

The precompile interacts directly with the EVM pallet on Tangle. The caller of the batch function will have their address act as the `msg.sender` for all subtransactions, but unlike [delegate calls](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#delegatecall-callcode-and-libraries), the target contract will still affect its own storage. It is effectively the same as if the user signed multiple transactions, but with only one confirmation.

The precompile is located at the following addresses:

- Tangle Mainnet: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000808`
- Tangle Testnet: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000808`

## The Batch Solidity Interface

Below is the Solidity interface for the batch precompile on Tangle, which exposes three functions:


<GithubFileReaderDisplay
  url="https://github.com/tangle-network/tangle/blob/main/precompiles/batch/Batch.sol"
  title="Solidity Interface for Tangle Batch Precompile"
/>

Below is more detail on how these functions work:

### batchSome

Performs multiple calls, where the same index of each array combines into the information required for a single subcall. If a subcall reverts, following subcalls will still be attempted.

- `to` — array of addresses to direct subtransactions to, where each entry is a subtransaction
- `value` — array of native currency values to send in the subtransactions, where the index corresponds to the subtransaction of the same index in the `to` array. If this array is shorter than the `to` array, all the following subtransactions will default to a value of 0
- `callData` — array of call data to include in the subtransactions, where the index corresponds to the subtransaction of the same index in the `to` array. If this array is shorter than the `to` array, all of the following subtransactions will include no call data
- `gasLimit` — array of gas limits for each subtransaction, where the index corresponds to the subtransaction of the same index in the `to` array. Values of 0 are interpreted as "unlimited" and will have all remaining gas of the batch transaction forwarded. If this array is shorter than the `to` array, all of the following subtransactions will have all remaining gas forwarded

### batchSomeUntilFailure

Performs multiple calls, where the same index of each array combines into the information required for a single subcall. If a subcall reverts, no following subcalls will be executed, but the successful subcalls remain intact. It does not revert the entire batch transaction.

- `to` — array of addresses to direct subtransactions to
- `value` — array of native currency values to send
- `callData` — array of call data to include in each subtransaction
- `gasLimit` — array of gas limits for each subtransaction

### batchAll

Performs multiple calls atomically. If a subcall reverts, all subcalls will revert.

- `to` — array of addresses to direct subtransactions to
- `value` — array of native currency values to send
- `callData` — array of call data to include in each subtransaction
- `gasLimit` — array of gas limits for each subtransaction

## Interact with the Solidity Interface

### Checking Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have:

- [MetaMask installed and connected to Tangle Testnet or Tangle Mainnet](#)
- Create or have two accounts on Tangle Testnet to test out the different features in the batch precompile
- At least one of the accounts will need to be funded with test tokens on Tangle Testnet.

### Example Contract

The following contract, `SimpleContract.sol`, will be used as an example of batching contract interactions, but in practice, any contract can be interacted with:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only
pragma solidity >=0.8.3;

contract SimpleContract {
    mapping(uint256 => string) public messages;

    function setMessage(uint256 id, string memory message) public {
        messages[id] = message;
    }
}
```

### Remix Set Up

You can interact with the batch precompile using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org). To add the interface and the example contract and follow along with this tutorial, you will need to:

1. Click on the **File explorer** tab in Remix
2. Create a file named **Batch.sol**, and paste in the batch interface shown above
3. Create a file named **SimpleContract.sol**, and paste in the `SimpleContract` provided above

### Compile the Contract

Next, you will need to compile both files in Remix:

1. Open the **Batch.sol** file
2. Click on the **Compile** tab
3. Click on **Compile Batch.sol**

If the interface was compiled successfully, you'll see a green checkmark next to the **Compile** tab. Then, repeat these steps for **SimpleContract.sol**.

### Access the Precompile

Instead of deploying the batch precompile, you will access the interface given the address of the precompiled contract:

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab (below the **Compile** tab) in Remix. The precompiled contract is already deployed on Tangle
2. Select **Injected Provider - MetaMask** under **ENVIRONMENT**. MetaMask may prompt you to connect your account
3. Ensure the correct account is displayed under **ACCOUNT**
4. Select **Batch - Batch.sol** under **CONTRACT**
5. Copy the batch precompile address for Tangle (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000808) and paste it into the **At Address** field
6. Click **At Address**

A new instance of **Batch - Batch.sol** will appear under **Deployed Contracts**.

### Deploy Example Contract

On the other hand, `SimpleContract.sol` will be deployed as a new contract. After compiling `SimpleContract.sol`:

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab
2. Select **Injected Provider - MetaMask** under **ENVIRONMENT**
3. Ensure the correct account is displayed under **ACCOUNT**
4. Select **SimpleContract - SimpleContract.sol** in the **CONTRACT** dropdown
5. Click **Deploy**
6. Confirm the MetaMask transaction

A new instance of **SimpleContract** will appear under **Deployed Contracts**.

### Send Native Currency via Precompile

Sending native currency with the batch precompile involves specifying which addresses to send to and how much to send, all in a single batch call. For this example, you'll use the **batchAll** function to send native currency atomically in Tangle Testnet:

1. Make sure you have enough test tokens in your connected wallet on Tangle Testnet
2. Expand the **Batch - Batch.sol** precompile instance
3. Expand the **batchAll** function
4. For the **to** input, provide the addresses you want to send tokens to, for example:
   `["ADDRESS_1", "ADDRESS_2"]`
5. For the **value** input, provide the amounts to send in Wei, for example:
   `["100000000000000000", "200000000000000000"]`
   which corresponds to 0.1 and 0.2 tokens respectively
6. For the **callData** and **gasLimit** inputs, provide empty arrays:
   `[]`
7. Click **transact**
8. Confirm in MetaMask

Once the transaction is complete, confirm both recipient addresses have the appropriate token balances in MetaMask or via a block explorer.

### Find a Contract Interaction's Call Data

Visual interfaces like Remix and libraries like [Ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) or [Web3.js](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js) encapsulate the call data used to interact with Solidity contracts, but you can also obtain it explicitly to use with the batch precompile.

Try finding a transaction's call data manually in Remix:

1. Expand the deployed `SimpleContract.sol` instance
2. Expand the **setMessage** function
3. Enter example values, such as `id = 1` and `message = "moonbeam"`
4. Instead of clicking **transact**, click the copy button next to it to copy the call data

This copied string is the function selector plus encoded arguments for the function call.

### Function Interaction via Precompile

To batch contract interactions, function inputs must be encoded as call data within the `callData` array. For an atomic operation where a single subcall failure reverts all subcalls:

1. Copy the address of your `SimpleContract.sol` instance
2. Expand the **Batch - Batch.sol** instance under **Deployed Contracts**
3. Expand the **batchAll** function
4. For **to**, insert your contract's address, for example:
   `["INSERT_SIMPLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"]`
5. For **value**, if your function call does not require any native currency, pass an array with `[0]`
6. For **callData**, insert the call data string you obtained earlier in brackets, for example:
   `["0x648345c800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000..."]`
7. For **gasLimit**, insert an empty array `[]` or the gas limit you wish to enforce
8. Click **transact** and confirm in MetaMask

Afterwards, you can verify the contract state change by calling functions (for example, `messages(1)`) on the deployed `SimpleContract`.

### Combining Subtransactions

So far, each operation has been separate, but the real power of batching is to combine transfers and contract interactions into a single transaction. For instance, consider these arrays when using **batchAll**:

• Three subtransactions:
  1. A native token transfer to some address
  2. A call to `SimpleContract` that sets a message
  3. Another call to `SimpleContract` that sets another message

• The `to` array might look like this:

```text
[
  "0x6Be02d1d3665660d22FF9624b7BE0551ee1Ac91b",
  "0xd14b70a55F6cBAc06d4FA49b99be0370D0e1BD39",
  "0xd14b70a55F6cBAc06d4FA49b99be0370D0e1BD39"
]
```

• The `value` array:

```text
["1000000000000000000", "0", "0"]
```

• The `callData` array (first item is empty, so the native token transfer does nothing beyond sending currency; the next two strings correspond to calls of `setMessage` with different parameters):

```text
[
  "0x",
  "0x648345c8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009796f752061726520610000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "0x648345c800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e61206d6f6f6e6265616d2070726f000000000000000000000000000000000000"
]
```

• And an empty array for `gasLimit`:

```text
[]
```

Entering these arrays under the **batchAll** function will execute all three subtransactions—one token transfer and two contract interactions—in a single transaction.
