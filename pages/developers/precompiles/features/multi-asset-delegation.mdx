# Interacting with the MultiAssetDelegation Precompile

## Introduction

Tangle supports multi-asset delegation through a built-in pallet in its runtime. To make it easy for developers to interact with this pallet using Ethereum-compatible tools, Tangle includes a precompiled contract at the following address:

- Tangle Mainnet and Tangle Testnet: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000822`

By calling this precompile using any standard Ethereum tool (Remix, web3 libraries, etc.), you can deposit assets, schedule asset withdrawals, delegate assets, and more—all without needing to interact directly with Substrate APIs. This guide demonstrates how to connect to the precompile contract and use its functions via the Tangle multi-asset delegation interface.

## The Tangle MultiAssetDelegation Solidity Interface

Below is the Solidity interface that provides access to the multi-asset delegation functionality of Tangle:

## Using the MultiAssetDelegation Precompile on Tangle

Below is an overview of how you can interact with the Tangle multi-asset delegation precompile in Remix. The same procedures also work for other Ethereum-compatible tools and libraries.

### Prerequisites

- MetaMask installed and connected to either Tangle Testnet or Mainnet
- An account funded with the relevant asset(s) on Tangle to deposit or delegate

### Accessing the Precompile in Remix

1. Navigate to the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org).
2. Create a new file named "MultiAssetDelegation.sol" (or any name you prefer), and paste in the Solidity interface shown above.
3. In the "Compile" tab, compile "MultiAssetDelegationInterface.sol".
4. In the "Deploy & Run" tab, from the ENVIRONMENT dropdown, select "Injected Provider - MetaMask".
5. Under "CONTRACT", choose the compiled interface ("MultiAssetDelegation - MultiAssetDelegation.sol").
6. In the text field next to the "At Address" button, enter the precompile address:
   `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000822`
7. Click on "At Address" to load the precompiled contract. The interface methods will appear under "Deployed Contracts."

## Example Calls

Below are example usages for some core methods on the multi-asset delegation interface. Make sure you have the correct asset IDs and token addresses (for ERC20 assets) whenever calling these methods. All calls below are made against the loaded precompile in Remix.

### 1. Deposit Assets

1. Expand the `deposit(uint256 assetId, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, uint8 lockMultiplier)` section.
2. Set `assetId` to `0` for ERC20 tokens, or provide another valid ID for other assets.
3. Provide the ERC20 contract address in `tokenAddress` if `assetId` is `0`. For native assets, set this to the zero address.
4. Enter the `amount` you wish to deposit (in your asset's smallest unit, e.g., Wei for WETH).
5. Specify a `lockMultiplier` value for lock duration rewards (`0` for no lock, higher values for increased rewards).
6. Click "transact" and confirm the MetaMask popup.

### 2. Schedule a Withdrawal

1. Expand `scheduleWithdraw(uint256 assetId, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`.
2. Fill in `assetId` (`0` for ERC20), `tokenAddress` (if `assetId` is `0`), and `amount`.
3. Click "transact" and approve the MetaMask transaction.
4. The withdrawal enters an unbonding period; you can execute it after the period ends or cancel it anytime.

### 3. Execute a Scheduled Withdrawal

1. Expand `executeWithdraw()`.
2. Click "transact".
3. Confirm the MetaMask transaction.
4. Any previously scheduled withdrawals that are now eligible will be executed.

### 4. Cancel a Scheduled Withdrawal

1. Expand `cancelWithdraw(uint256 assetId, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`.
2. Provide the details of the scheduled withdrawal you wish to cancel (`assetId`, `tokenAddress` for ERC20 if needed, and the identical amount).
3. Click "transact" and confirm the Metamask transaction.

### 5. Delegate to an Operator

1. Expand `delegate(bytes32 operator, uint256 assetId, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, uint64[] memory blueprintSelection)`.
2. Enter the operator (as a bytes32 account ID), the asset ID, token address if assetId is `0` (ERC20), the amount to delegate.
3. Provide `blueprintSelection` as an array of blueprint IDs the operator should participate in.
4. Click "transact" to delegate your assets to the operator.

### 6. Schedule Unstake for Delegators

1. Expand `scheduleDelegatorUnstake(bytes32 operator, uint256 assetId, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`.
2. Input the operator you previously delegated to and the relevant asset parameters.
3. Enter the amount you wish to unstake.
4. Click "transact" and confirm in MetaMask.

### 7. Execute Scheduled Unstake for Delegators

1. Expand `executeDelegatorUnstake()`.
2. Click "transact" and confirm the transaction.
3. Any eligible scheduled unstake operations will finalize.

### 8. Cancel Scheduled Unstake

1. Expand `cancelDelegatorUnstake(bytes32 operator, uint256 assetId, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`.
2. Provide the same operator, asset details, and amount that were set when scheduling the unstake.
3. Click "transact" to cancel the unstake operation.

### 9. Check Overall Balance

1. Expand `balanceOf(address who, uint256 assetId, address tokenAddress)`.
2. Enter the address you want to inspect, assetId (`0` for ERC20), and `tokenAddress` if needed.
3. Click "call" to see the total amount of assets held (deposited but not yet delegated).

### 10. Check Delegated Balance

1. Expand `delegatedBalanceOf(address who, uint256 assetId, address tokenAddress)`.
2. Enter the delegator's address, along with the relevant asset parameters.
3. Click "call" to see how many of the delegator’s tokens are actively delegated.

## Asset Types

- **Asset ID 0**: ERC20 tokens (requires token address)
- **Asset ID 1+**: Native or custom assets configured in the runtime

## Lock Multipliers

The `lockMultiplier` parameter in the deposit function allows users to lock their assets for longer periods in exchange for increased rewards:
- `0`: No lock (standard delegation)
- Higher values: Longer lock periods with proportionally higher reward multipliers

## Blueprint Selection

When delegating, the `blueprintSelection` parameter specifies which service blueprints the operator should run on your behalf. This enables targeted delegation to specific services or applications.

## More Information

For a complete list of methods and their parameters, refer to the Solidity interface above. This interface exposes all the critical multi-asset delegation functionality provided by Tangle's runtime, enabling you to manage deposits, schedule and execute withdrawals, delegate tokens, and unstake as needed—all through an Ethereum-compatible workflow. Make sure to handle asset IDs, token addresses, and amounts accurately to avoid transaction failures.
