# Overview of the Precompiled Contracts on Tangle

## Overview

On Tangle Network, a precompiled contract is native Substrate code that has an Ethereum-style address and can be called using the Ethereum API, like any other smart contract. The precompiles allow you to call the Substrate runtime directly which is not normally accessible from the Ethereum side of Tangle.

The Substrate code responsible for implementing precompiles can be found in the EVM pallet. The EVM pallet includes the [standard precompiles found on Ethereum and some additional precompiles that are not specific to Ethereum](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/tree/master/frame/evm/precompile). It also provides the ability to create and execute custom precompiles through the generic [`Precompiles` trait](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm/trait.Precompile.html). There are several custom Tangle-specific precompiles that have been created.

The Ethereum precompiled contracts contain complex functionality that is computationally intensive, such as hashing and encryption. The custom precompiled contracts on Tangle provide access to Substrate-based functionality such as staking, governance, and more.

The Tangle-specific precompiles can be interacted with through familiar and easy-to-use Solidity interfaces using the Ethereum API, which are ultimately used to interact with the underlying Substrate interface. This flow is depicted in the following diagram:

```

## Precompiled Contract Addresses

The precompiled contracts are categorized by address and based on the origin network. If you were to convert the precompiled addresses to decimal format, and break them into categories by numeric value, the categories are as follows:

- **0-1023** - [Ethereum MainNet precompiles](#ethereum-precompiles)
- **1024-2047** - precompiles that are [not in Ethereum and not Tangle specific](#non-tangle-specific-nor-ethereum-precompiles)
- **2048-4095** - [Tangle specific precompiles](#tangle-specific-precompiles)
