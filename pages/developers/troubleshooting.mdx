# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps developers troubleshoot common issues when working with Tangle Network blueprints and AVS development.

## Common Issues

### Blueprint Metadata Build Failures

If you encounter build failures when developing blueprints:

```bash
error: failed to run custom build command for `<YOUR_BLUEPRINT> v0.1.0 (<PATH_TO_YOUR_BLUEPRINT>)`

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `<PATH_TO_YOUR_BLUEPRINT>/target/release/build/<YOUR_BLUEPRINT>-<ID>/build-script-build` (exit status: 101)
  --- stdout

```

Verify that your blueprint's jobs and reports are implemented correctly. Occasionally, our SDK may have breaking changes to the error reporting. You will want to consider commenting out metadata generation and then rebuilding to check for errors in the blueprint.
