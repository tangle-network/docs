# EVM Contract Listeners

EVM Contract Listeners are a powerful feature in the Gadget SDK that allow your blueprint to react to events emitted by smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains. These listeners use the `alloy` crate, which provides a robust and efficient way to interact with EVM chains.

## Overview

EVM Contract Listeners enable your blueprint to:

1. Monitor specific smart contracts for events
2. React to these events in real-time
3. Trigger custom logic based on the event data

# EvmContractEventListener

The `EvmContractEventListener` is a type that listens to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for events.

Like the `TangleEventListener`, the `EvmContractEventListener` is already implemented and ready to use. Simply register it in the `job` macro, and your application will automatically work with the EVM.

## Pre-processor

EVM Contract events benefit from a simple pre-processor that extracts the parameters you need from the raw event data. An example of this is shown below:
