# EVM Contract Listeners

EVM Contract Listeners are a powerful feature in the Gadget SDK that allow your blueprint to react to events emitted by smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains. These listeners use the `alloy` crate, which provides a robust and efficient way to interact with EVM chains.

## Overview

EVM Contract Listeners enable your blueprint to:

1. Monitor specific smart contracts for events
2. React to these events in real-time
3. Trigger custom logic based on the event data
