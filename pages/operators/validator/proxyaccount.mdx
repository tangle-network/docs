# Setting Up a Proxy Account

A proxy account allows you to delegate some functionalities to another account, which can act on behalf of the primary account. Polkadot.js Apps also provides an option to create a time-delayed proxy, enhancing security by giving the primary account time to review and potentially cancel transactions before they are executed.

## Creating a Proxy Account

### Using the Extrinsics Page

1. **Navigate to the Extrinsics Page**:

   - Click on the `Developer` tab.
   - Select `Extrinsics` from the dropdown.

2. **Input Proxy Details**:

   - Select your primary account.
   - From the dropdown, choose `proxy` > `addProxy`.
   - Specify the delegate account for the proxy.
   - Choose `Balances` from the `proxyType` dropdown.
   - Optionally, set a time delay (in block numbers) to add a waiting period before the proxy can act.

3. **Finalize the Proxy**:
   - Click `Submit Transaction`.
   - Authorize and sign the transaction to establish the proxy relationship.
   - A confirmation will appear once the transaction is successful.

### Using the Accounts Page

1. **Navigate to Your Accounts**:

   - Go to the `Accounts` page.
   - Find your primary account and click on the three vertical dots next to it.
