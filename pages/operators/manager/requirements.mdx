# Runtime Requirements for the Blueprint Manager

Blueprints can be executed in multiple ways (see [Sources](/developers/deployment/sources/introduction)), with each requiring
certain dependencies, and possibly hardware.

## Native Sources

There are two ways to run blueprints with [Native Sources](/developers/deployment/sources/native) in the
`blueprint-manager`: sandboxed (**recommended**) or not

In either case, the following dependencies will be needed:

* [GitHub CLI] (for binary attestations)

Then additionally for the two execution methods:

### Not Sandboxed

No extra dependencies, the blueprint will run as a normal host process.

### Sandboxed (**Linux Only**)

* [cloud-hypervisor]
  * Note, no additional setup of `cloud-hypervisor` needs to be done. The manager handles downloading the latest kernel
    and disk images. Simply installing and adding it to `PATH` is enough.
* Allow `CAP_NET_ADMIN` for the `blueprint-manager` binary
  * This can be done by running `setcap cap_net_admin+eip /path/to/blueprint-manager`
  * ***or*** simply running the `blueprint-manager` as root (**not recommended**)

## Container Sources

The requirements for running blueprints with [Container Sources](/developers/deployment/sources/container) are:

* [Kubernetes]
* [Docker]
* The [Kata Containers] runtime

## TEE Sources (WIP, **Linux Only**)

The requirements for running blueprints with [TEE Sources](/developers/deployment/sources/tee) are:

* [dstack VMM]
* TODO?

## WASM Sources (WIP)

The requirements for running blueprints with [WASM Sources](/developers/deployment/sources/wasm) are:

* TODO
