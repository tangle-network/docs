    </Callout>

    {t('Becoming a validator on a decentralized network like Tangle is a big responsibility and a fairly technical process. **You are accountable for both your stake and the stake of your nominators. Any errors could lead to slashing of tokens, impacting your balance and reputation.** However, there are also rewards - you help secure a decentralized network and can grow your stake through nominations.')}

    {t('To become a validator, you need substantial system administration skills to set up infrastructure and resolve anomalies independently. Follow security best practices, as this is crucial for success. The validator role involves more than just running a node.')}

    {t('You don't have to go it alone. Connect with experienced teams and fellow validators in communities like the Tangle [Discord Validator channel.](https://discord.com/invite/cv8EfJu3Tn) They can provide invaluable insights and support. Carefully weigh the risks and rewards, prepare thoroughly, and leverage the community.')}

    {t('Generally, the process for becoming a validator involves three steps:')}

    <ol>
      <li>{t('**Bonding Tokens:** Before a node can become a validator, the node operator usually needs to bond (or stake) a certain amount of tokens. This is a way of putting up collateral that can be slashed (or forfeited) if the validator behaves maliciously or fails to properly validate transactions and blocks. Bonding is a way of ensuring that validators have a vested interest in properly maintaining the network.')}</li>

        {t('**How much TNT do I need to be an active Validator?**')}

        {t('To be elected to the active validator set (to recieve block rewards), you need a minimum stake behind your validator. This can come from yourself or nominators. This means at a minimum, you'll need enough TNT for stash and staking accounts with the existential deposit, plus extra for fees. The rest can come from nominators. To understand validator election, check the [NPoS election algorithms page.](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-phragmen#what-is-the-sequential-phragm%C3%A9n-method)')}

        {t('In the future, validators may be able to participate in other forms of reward-winning activities without participating in block rewards.')}
      </Callout>

      <li>{t('**Setting Up Validator Infrastructure:** This includes ensuring that the node is properly configured, connected to the network, has the necessary keys set up, etc. Part of this setup will involve generating and injecting session keys (like RoleKey, Babe, Grandpa, etc.) which are crucial for various consensus and validation processes.')}</li>

      <li>{t('**Nominating or Registering as a Validator:** After bonding tokens and setting up the validator node, the operator then registers or nominate their node as a validator candidate. This involves submitting a transaction to the network indicating their intention to validate.')}</li>

Keep most of your funds in the stash account since it is meant to be the custodian of your staking funds. While you are not required to use a staking proxy, it is highly recommended.

On Polkadot, the planned unbonding period is 28 days.')}
