## Troubleshooting

<Callout>
### Logs

If you'd like to run the node with verbose logs, you may add the following arguments during initial setup. Adjust the target for the desired logging level (debug | error | info| trace | warn):

```bash
RUST_LOG=runtime=debug ./target/release/<YOUR-NODE-TEMPLATE> --dev
```

Refer substrate [doc](https://docs.substrate.io/test/debug/) for more details

### P2P Ports Not Open

If you don't see an "Imported" message (without the [Relaychain] tag), check the P2P port configuration. Ensure the P2P port is open to incoming traffic.

### In Sync

Both chains must be in sync at all times. Look for "Imported" or "Idle" messages and ensure you have connected peers.

### Genesis Mismatching

If you notice log messages like:

```bash
DATE [Relaychain] Bootnode with peer id ID is on a different chain (our genesis: 0x3f5... theirs: 0x45j...)
```

You may be running an older version and need to upgrade.

### Troubleshooting for Apple Silicon users

#### Homebrew and PATH Configuration

If you haven't installed Homebrew: https://brew.sh/

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Make sure Homebrew is up-to-date, install openssl

```bash
brew update
brew install openssl
```

After installation, ensure you've added /opt/homebrew/bin to your PATH:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

#### Dependencies

1. GMP: Ensure the gmp dependency is correctly installed.

```bash
brew install gmp
```

2. If you're still facing an issue with gmp, adjust your path to the gmp lib:

```bash
cargo clean
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:$(brew --prefix)/lib:$(brew --prefix)/opt/gmp/lib
```

Add the above export to your bash_profile as well.

3. Ensure the Protobuf dependency is correctly installed:

```bash
brew install protobuf
```
