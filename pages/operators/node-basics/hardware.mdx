# Hardware

The current Tangle testnet is a standalone network, meaning that it is not connected to the Polkadot or Kusama relay chain.
Since the Tangle is not a parachain, the size of nodes are quite a small build as it only contains code to run the standalone Tangle network and not syncing
the relay chain or communicate between the two. As such, the build is smaller, and does not require the same minumum spec requirements as a parachain node.

The following specifications are the ideal or recommended, but nodes can be run with less. Testnet nodes have also been run using AWS t3.Large instances.

| Component | Requirements                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU       | Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz                                                               |
| Storage   | An NVMe solid state drive of 500 GB (As it should be reasonably sized to deal with blockchain growth). |
| Memory    | 32GB ECC                                                                                               |
| Firewall  | P2P port must be open to incoming traffic: <br /> - Source: Any <br /> - Destination: 30333, 30334 TCP |

### Running Ports

As stated before, the standalone nodes will listen on multiple ports. The default Substrate ports are used in the standalone chain.

The only ports that need to be open for incoming traffic are those designated for P2P.

**Default Ports for a Tangle Full-Node:**

| Description | Port        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| P2P         | 30333 (TCP) |
| RPC         | 9933        |
| WS          | 9944        |
| Prometheus  | 9615        |
