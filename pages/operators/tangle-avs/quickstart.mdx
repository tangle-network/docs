# Tangle AVS: Quickstart Guide

The following is a guide outlining the steps to set up and utilize **Tangle AVS** (Actively Validated Services),
allowing you to run a Tangle Validator on **EigenLayer**'s network. Further explanation of the cross-chain mechanisms offered by
Tangle AVS can be found in the [Cross-Chain](cross-chain.mdx) section.

For information on hardware requirements, see the [Hardware](../../operators/node-basics/hardware.mdx) section.

<Callout type="info">
    Ensure that you have everything necessary for running a Tangle node and have access to the necessary network
    configurations for EigenLayer or any other network you plan to connect to.
</Callout>

## Setup

The AVS is designed to automatically handle as much of the setup process as possible, so that you can focus on running your
Tangle node. Some specific configurations are in the midst of being implemented, and they will be added in a future update.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```sh filename="git clone" copy
   git clone https://github.com/tangle-network/avs.git tangle-avs
   cd tangle-avs
```

2. Build:

```sh filename="cargo build" copy
cargo build --release
```

### Running Tests

If you would like to ensure the Tangle AVS works as you would expect, you can test it against local testnets. You can run the following command while a local Tangle testnet is running.

```sh filename="cargo test" copy
RUST_LOG=gadget=trace cargo test test_full_tangle_avs -- --nocapture
```
