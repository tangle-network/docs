# Network Parameters

This page outlines the key parameters and attributes of the Tangle network. Please note that some of these values may be subject to change via on-chain governance. For the most up-to-date and accurate values, it is recommended to check the constants directly by inspecting the [chain state](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate/constants) and/or [storage](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate).

### Fee Structure

- Dust (small, uneconomical to track amounts) is burned.
- Fees are split as follows:
  - 80% goes to the treasury
  - 20% goes to the block author (validator)
- 100% of tips go to block authors, similar to gas fees on other networks.

### Epoch and Era Durations

- Slot: 6 seconds (generally one block per slot)
- Epoch: 4 hours (2,400 slots x 6 seconds)
- Session: 4 hours (Session and Epoch lengths are the same)
- Era: 24 hours (6 sessions per Era, 2,400 slots x 6 epochs x 6 seconds)

| Tangle  | Time      | Slots  |
| ------- | --------- | ------ |
| Slot    | 6 seconds | 1      |
| Epoch   | 4 hours   | 2,400  |
| Session | 4 hours   | 2,400  |
| Era     | 24 hours  | 14,400 |

### Block Time

The Tangle network targets a 6-second block time.

### Governance

- The total minimum deposit for a governance proposal is `PREIMAGE_DEPOSIT + DEMO_MINIMUM_DEPOSIT = 100 + 1000 + (preimage byte fee) > 1100`.
