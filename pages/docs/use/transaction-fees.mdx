# Transaction Fees on Tangle Network

## Introduction

Tangle Network, like many blockchain platforms, requires users to pay transaction fees to execute transactions on the network. These fees serve multiple purposes:

1. Prevent abuse: By attaching a cost to each transaction, the network discourages users from spamming or consuming excessive resources.
2. Incentivize block producers: Transaction fees act as a reward for block producers, encouraging them to include transactions in their blocks.
3. Sustainable economic model: Fees help maintain a sustainable economic model for the network by balancing resource consumption and network usage.

In this article, we'll explore how transaction fees are calculated and handled on Tangle Network.

## The Building Blocks of Transaction Fees

Tangle Network employs a weight-based fee model, which means that fees are calculated based on the computational resources required to execute a transaction. The fee structure consists of three main components:

1. **Base Fee**: A fixed fee applied to every transaction, regardless of its complexity.
2. **Weight Fee**: A variable fee that depends on the computational resources required by the transaction. Each operation in the transaction is assigned a specific weight, and the total weight determines the weight fee.
3. **Length Fee**: A fee proportional to the size of the transaction in bytes. Larger transactions incur higher length fees.

In addition to these components, users can optionally include a **tip** to prioritize their transactions. Tips incentivize block producers to include the transaction in the next block.

## Calculating Transaction Fees

The formula for calculating the total transaction fee on Tangle Network is as follows:

`total_fee = base_fee + weight_fee + (length_fee * transaction_size) + tip`

Here's a breakdown of each component:

- **Base Fee**: A fixed value set by the network, e.g., 100 uTNT (micro-TNT).
- **Weight Fee**: Calculated based on the weights of the individual operations in the transaction. The network defines a weight-to-fee conversion rate.
- **Length Fee**: A fixed value multiplied by the transaction size in bytes, e.g., 0.1 uTNGL per byte.
- **Tip**: An optional value determined by the user to prioritize their transaction.

## Dynamic Fee Adjustment

To maintain network stability and performance, Tangle Network implements a dynamic fee adjustment mechanism. This mechanism adjusts the fees based on network congestion and block saturation.

If the network experiences high traffic and blocks are consistently full, the fees will gradually increase to prioritize high-value transactions and prevent network congestion. Conversely, if the network is underutilized, fees will decrease to encourage more transactions.

The fee adjustment is controlled by a multiplier that is updated after each block, taking into account the saturation of the previous block compared to the current block.

## Other Resource Management Strategies

In addition to transaction fees, Tangle Network employs other resource management strategies:

- **Bonds**: Certain actions, such as voting, may require users to lock up funds (bond) that are released or slashed based on the outcome of the action.
- **Deposits**: Some operations, like registering an identity, require a deposit to cover the long-term storage costs. The deposit is returned if the user frees up the storage.
- **Burns**: In some cases, the network may burn a portion of the transaction fee to permanently remove it from circulation, effectively reducing the token supply.
- **Limits**: The network enforces certain limits, such as the maximum number of validators a nominator can nominate, to manage system complexity and resource consumption.
