# Building LRT on Tangle Network

Tangle Multi-Asset Delegations (MADs) pallet precompile provides information about the current state of the Tangle network restaking functionality.
A precompiled contract is native Substrate code that has an Ethereum-style address and can be called using the Ethereum API, like any other smart contract.
The precompiles allow you to call the Substrate runtime directly which is not normally accessible from the Ethereum side of Tangle.

### How to use the precompile

We have a detailed page about the [Multi-Asset Delegation Precompile](../../developers/precompiles/features/multi-asset-delegation.mdx).

In the next page, we will have a tutorial about how to use this precompile to build a LRT on Tangle.
