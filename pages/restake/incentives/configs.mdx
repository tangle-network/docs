# Restaking Rewards Configs

## Setting Incentive APY and Cap

The `set_incentive_apy_and_cap` function allows the network (democracy) to configure the APY and cap for a specific asset Vault, ensuring that stakers know the potential rewards and the upper limits of participation for rewards.

- **Function:** `set_incentive_apy_and_cap`
- **Description:** Sets the APY (Annual Percentage Yield) and cap for a specific asset Vault.
- **Inputs:**
  - `Vault_id`: The ID of the Vault for which the APY and cap are being set.
  - `apy`: The APY (percent) to be applied to the Vault.
  - `cap`: The maximum amount of staked assets eligible for rewards in this Vault.

Once set, the APY and cap are used to calculate the total rewards distributed among operators and delegators based on their staked amounts.

## Whitelisting Blueprints for Rewards

The network allows developers to create blueprints for restaking services. These blueprints can be whitelisted for rewards, meaning services built using these blueprints can attract incentivized staking.

- **Function:** `whitelist_blueprint_for_rewards`
- **Description:** Whitelists a blueprint, allowing services using this blueprint to be eligible for reward distribution.
