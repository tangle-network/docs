## Unstake Using PolkadotJS

The first step to exit restake is to unstake your tokens. This is done by calling the `unstake` function, which releases the locked assets and returns them to the deposit vault.

Then, you can withdraw your assets from the deposit vault. See the [Withdraw page](./withdraw.mdx) for more information.

Unstaking is a two step process:

1. Call the `schedule_unstake` function to schedule the unstake request.
2. Call the `execute_unstake` function to execute the unstake request and release the funds after the unstake period has elapsed.

### Schedule Unstake

To unstake, you need to call the `schedule_unstake` function. This function schedules the unstake.

### Step 1: Access the PolkadotJS Interface

- Open [PolkadotJS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).
- Connect to the Tangle Network by selecting the appropriate network from the dropdown list.

For convenience, here are the PolkadotJS direct links for Tangle Testnet and Mainnet:

- Tangle Mainnet: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.tangle.tools#/explorer

### Step 2: Schedule Unstake

- Navigate to the **Developer** → **Extrinsics** tab on PolkadotJS.

- Under the **MultiAssetDelegation** section, select **ScheduleUnstake** and enter the amount of assets to unstake.

Sign and submit the transaction. Make sure the account you are using has enough balance to cover the transaction fee.

### Cancel Delegator Unstake

To cancel the unstake, you need to call the `cancel_delegator_unstake` function. This function cancels the unstake.

### Step 1: Access the PolkadotJS Interface

- Open [PolkadotJS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).
- Connect to the Tangle Network by selecting the appropriate network from the dropdown list.

- Tangle Mainnet: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.tangle.tools#/explorer

### Step 2: Cancel Delegator Unstake

- Navigate to the **Developer** → **Extrinsics** tab on PolkadotJS.

- Under the **MultiAssetDelegation** section, select **CancelDelegatorUnstake** and enter the amount of assets to unstake.

Sign and submit the transaction. Make sure the account you are using has enough balance to cover the transaction fee.

### Execute Delegator Unstake

To execute the unstake, you need to call the `execute_unstake` function. This function executes the unstake. This function can only be called after the unstake period.

### Step 1: Access the PolkadotJS Interface

- Open [PolkadotJS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).
- Connect to the Tangle network by selecting the appropriate network from the dropdown list.

For convenience, here are the PolkadotJS direct links for Tangle Testnet and Mainnet:

- Tangle Mainnet: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.tangle.tools#/explorer

### Step 2: Execute Delegator Unstake

- Navigate to the **Developer** → **Extrinsics** tab on PolkadotJS.

![PolkadotJS Extrinsics](/images/extrinsic.png)

- Under the **multiAssetDelegation** section, select **executeDelegatorUnstake()**.
- Notice that there aren't any inputs for this function. This is because calling the function will execute **all** pending unstake requests that have reached their maturity.

- Sign and submit the transaction. Make sure the account you are using has enough balance to cover the transaction fee.
