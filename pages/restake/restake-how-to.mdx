# How to Restake on Tangle Network

## Introduction to Restaking

This guide will walk you through the process of restaking using PolkadotJS, explaining important concepts along the way.

## Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. **Staking**

- **Definition:** Staking involves locking up your tokens in a staking pool to help secure the network and, in return, you earn staking rewards. The staked tokens are used by validators to participate in block production and consensus.
- **Impact:** By staking, you're contributing to the security and decentralization of the network, while earning rewards.

### 2. **Restaking**

- **Definition:** Restaking is a process where staked tokens are reused to support additional services, such as providing security or computation for decentralized applications, without unstaking them from the original pool.
- **Benefit:** Restaking allows you to earn extra rewards from multiple sources while maintaining your original staking rewards.

### 3. **Operator**

- **Definition:** An operator is a validator or participant who manages restaking by offering services such as security or computation in exchange for additional rewards. By restaking, you can delegate your tokens to an operator.

## How to Restake Using PolkadotJS

### Step 1: Access PolkadotJS

- **Action:** Visit the [PolkadotJS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).
- **Select the Tangle Network:** Use the dropdown menu in the top-left corner of the interface to switch to the Tangle Network.

### Step 2: LiquidStake Your Tokens (If Not Already Staked)

- **Action:** If you haven't staked your tokens yet, navigate to the **Lst** tab, click on \*Join\*\*, and follow the steps to stake your tokens. Ensure that the tokens are bonded to a validator.
- **Note:** You must first stake your tokens before you can participate in restaking.

### Step 3: Deposit Your LST Tokens

- **Action:** Navigate to the **Lst** tab, click on **Deposit**, and follow the steps to deposit your LST tokens.

### Step 4: Select an Operator for Delegation

- **Action:** Review the list of operators or services and select one that suits your goals (e.g., maximizing rewards or contributing to a specific decentralized application).
- **Click on “Restake” or “Delegate Tokens”**: This option allows you to reuse your staked tokens for the chosen service without unstaking them from the original pool.

### Step 5: Track Your Rewards

- **Action:** You can monitor the performance of your restaked tokens and track your rewards under the **Dashboard** or **Restaking** section in PolkadotJS.
- **Claiming Rewards:** Periodically, you can claim the additional rewards earned from restaking, as well as your base staking rewards.

## Risks of Restaking

### 1. **Validator and Operator Risk**

- **Risk:** The performance of the operator you restake with may affect the rewards you earn. Poorly performing operators may result in reduced rewards or penalties.
- **Mitigation:** Choose operators with a solid track record and transparent operations.

### 2. **Smart Contract Risk**

- **Risk:** Restaking often involves interacting with smart contracts or decentralized applications. Smart contract vulnerabilities could lead to loss of funds.
- **Mitigation:** Ensure that the protocol or operator has been audited and has strong security practices in place.

### 3. **Complexity of Managing Multiple Restaking Activities**

- **Risk:** Managing multiple restaking activities can be complex and may require close monitoring to optimize returns.
- **Mitigation:** Start with smaller amounts and monitor the performance of each service before fully committing your tokens.
