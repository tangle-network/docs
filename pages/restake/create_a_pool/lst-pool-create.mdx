  - **Initial deposit amount**: The amount of tokens you are contributing to the pool. This is in lowest unit, so should use 18 decimal places.
  - **Root account**: The account that will be responsible for managing the pool.
  - **Nominator account**: The account that will nominate validators for the pool.
  - **Bouncer account**: The account responsible for managing participant entries and exits.
  - **Pool Name**: Choose a unique and descriptive name for your pool.

You can use the same account for the root, nominator and bouncer or different accounts.
