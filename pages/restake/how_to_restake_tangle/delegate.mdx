## Delegate Using Tangle DApp

<Callout type="info">
You should have deposited your tokens to the multiasset delegation vault before you can delegate. See the [Deposit Using Tangle DApp page](./deposit-tangle.mdx) for more information.
</Callout>

Delegators are similar to stakers in a consensus system like nominated proof of stake (NPoS), but they delegate their tokens to an operator, and participate in the rewards and risks similar to staking on a validator.

### Step 1: Access Tangle DApp & Connect Wallet

- Open [Tangle DApp's Restaking page](https://app.tangle.tools/restake/stake).
- Connect your wallet to the DApp by clicking on the **Connect Wallet** button on the top right and selecting your preferred wallet provider.

### Step 2: Delegate

1. Switch to the **Stake** tab on the Restaking page.
2. Ensure that you're connected to the appropriate network. You can switch networks by using the dropdown located at the top right corner of the page.
3. Select an asset from the modal.
4. Enter the desired amount to deposit.
5. Select an operator from the list, which will be used to restake the deposited assets. You can also search for specific operators by entering their address in the search bar.
6. Review any fees, APY, and other key information before proceeding.
7. If all the information is correct, the **Deposit + Delegate** button should be enabled. Click on it to initiate the transaction.
