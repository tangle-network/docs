# Supported Assets on Tangle Restaking

## Supported Assets

Supported assets include all "liquid" assets on Tangle Network, including liquid staked TNT tokens. The network does not limit or restrict the assets that can be used for restaking. But assets are
preferred by adding them to a reward pool.

## Integrate New Assets

New assets may be added through on-chain governance and TNT community approval.

To discuss new assets, you can [discuss at our forum.](https://commonwealth.im/tangle/discussions)
