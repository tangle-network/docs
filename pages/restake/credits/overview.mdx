# Tangle Credits System

## Overview

The Tangle Credits system provides a mechanism for users to earn cloud computing credits through their participation in the network. These credits can be used to pay for services and computational resources within the Tangle ecosystem. The system rewards both active participation (through token burning) and passive participation (through staking).

## How Credits Work

The credits system operates on a dual-layer architecture:

- **On-chain tracking**: The blockchain tracks potential credits earned through staking and burning
- **Off-chain accounting**: External systems manage actual credit balances and redemption

This design ensures transparency in credit earning while maintaining flexibility in credit usage and management.

## Earning Credits

### Through Staking (Passive Accrual)

When you stake TNT tokens through the multi-asset delegation system, you automatically accrue credits over time:

1. **Stake-based emission**: Credits are generated based on your staked amount
2. **Tier system**: Different stake levels unlock different emission rates
3. **Time-based accrual**: Credits accumulate block by block
4. **Capped accumulation**: Credit accrual is limited to prevent excessive accumulation

#### Stake Tiers

The network uses a tiered system to reward larger stakes with better emission rates:

| Tier   | Minimum Stake | Credits per Block |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Basic  | 100 TNT       | 0.01 credits      |
| Bronze | 1,000 TNT     | 0.12 credits      |
| Silver | 10,000 TNT    | 1.25 credits      |
| Gold   | 100,000 TNT   | 13 credits        |

_Note: These values are configurable and may be updated through governance_

### Through Token Burning (Active Generation)

For immediate credit generation, users can burn TNT tokens:

1. **Direct conversion**: Burned tokens are converted to credits at a configured ratio
2. **Instant availability**: Credits from burning are immediately available
3. **Permanent commitment**: Burned tokens are permanently removed from circulation

## Using Credits

### Credit Claiming Process

To use your earned credits:

1. **Calculate available credits**: The system calculates your accrued credits based on staking history
2. **Claim credits**: Submit a claim transaction with your desired amount and off-chain account ID
3. **Event emission**: The blockchain emits an event confirming your claim
4. **Off-chain processing**: External systems process the event and credit your account

### Credit Usage

Credits can be used for:

- **Service payments**: Pay for blueprint service execution
- **Computational resources**: Access network computational power
- **Storage services**: Pay for decentralized storage
- **Premium features**: Access advanced network capabilities

## Technical Integration

### For Users

Users can interact with the credits system through:

- **Tangle dApp**: Web interface for viewing and claiming credits
- **Direct extrinsics**: Substrate API calls for programmatic access
- **EVM precompile**: Solidity interface for Ethereum-compatible tools

### For Developers

Developers can integrate credits into their applications:

- **Query credit balances**: Check available credits for users
- **Accept credit payments**: Build services that accept credits
- **Monitor credit events**: Track credit claims and burns
- **Implement credit-based pricing**: Create dynamic pricing models

## Important Considerations

### Time Windows

- Credit accrual is limited to a configurable time window (typically 30 days)
- Unclaimed credits beyond this window may be forfeited
- Regular claiming is recommended to maximize credit utilization

### Stake Changes

- Increasing your stake immediately affects your emission rate
- Decreasing your stake or unstaking stops credit accrual
- Credits already earned remain claimable

### Network Parameters

The following parameters are configurable through governance:

- Stake tier thresholds and rates
- Maximum accrual window
- Burn-to-credit conversion ratio
- Minimum claim amounts

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Long-term Staker

Alice stakes 10,000 TNT tokens:

- Earns 1.25 credits per block
- After 28,800 blocks (approximately 2 days): 36,000 credits
- Claims credits weekly for consistent service usage

### Scenario 2: Immediate Needs

Bob needs credits immediately for a critical service:

- Burns 100 TNT tokens
- Receives 100 credits instantly (1:1 ratio)
- Uses credits for immediate service execution

### Scenario 3: Hybrid Approach

Charlie combines both methods:

- Stakes 50,000 TNT for passive income
- Burns small amounts when needing extra credits
- Maintains consistent credit availability
