# Cloud Credits Pallet

## Overview

The Cloud Credits pallet provides an on-chain mechanism for tracking **potential usage credits** earned through staking TNT or burning TNT. It is designed to work with an off-chain system that listens to events to manage actual user credit balances.

The pallet integrates with Tangle's multi-asset delegation system to reward users who stake TNT tokens by tracking passively accrued potential credits within a defined time window.

## Key Features

### Staking-Based Potential Credit Accrual

- Tracks potential credits earned based on TNT stake via `MultiAssetDelegationInfo`
- Accrual is **capped** to a configurable time window (`ClaimWindowBlocks`)
- Users do not accrue additional potential credits for periods longer than this window without claiming

### Stake Tier Configuration

- Credit emission rates based on stake size are defined via `StakeTier` structs
- Configured during genesis and stored on-chain
- Higher stake amounts unlock higher emission rates per block

### TNT Burning Event

- Burning TNT emits an event (`CreditsGrantedFromBurn`) indicating potential credits granted
- Credits are available for immediate off-chain use
- Burned tokens are permanently removed from circulation or sent to a configured recipient

### Credit Claiming Event

- Users initiate a claim on-chain with an off-chain account ID
- The pallet calculates potential credits accrued within the `ClaimWindowBlocks` ending at the current block
- Verifies the requested amount against calculated value and emits a `CreditsClaimed` event
- **No on-chain balance is stored or deducted** - this is purely for event emission

### Window Cap

- Inactivity beyond the `ClaimWindowBlocks` results in no further potential credit accrual for that past period
- Encourages regular claiming to maximize credit earning

## How It Works

### Earning Credits

**Through Staking (Passive Accrual):**

1. Stake TNT tokens through Tangle's multi-asset delegation system
2. Credits automatically accrue based on your staked amount and the configured tier rates
3. Accrual is calculated per block within the claim window
4. Higher stake amounts may qualify for higher tier emission rates

### Claiming Credits

1. Call the `claim_credits` extrinsic with:
   - Amount to claim (must not exceed calculated accrued amount)
   - Off-chain account ID for credit association
2. The pallet verifies the claim amount against accrued potential credits
3. Emits a `CreditsClaimed` event for off-chain processing
4. Updates the reward tracking block to prevent double-claiming
