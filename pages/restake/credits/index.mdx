## What Are Credits?

Credits are a way for re-stakers on Tangle to earn credits on [ai.tangle.tools](https://ai.tangle.tools). When you stake TNT tokens, you automatically earn credits that can be used for AI services like text generation, image creation, and other AI tools.

## How to Earn Credits

Stake TNT/LstTNT tokens on Tangle and you'll automatically start earning credits. The more TNT you stake, the more credits you earn over time. You don't need to do anything special - just stake your tokens and credits accumulate automatically.

## How to Use Your Credits

1. Stake TNT tokens on Tangle
2. Visit [ai.tangle.tools](https://ai.tangle.tools)
3. Claim your accumulated credits

### Earning Mechanism

Credits accumulate based on your staked TNT amount. Higher stake amounts earn credits at a higher rate.

### Credit Expiry

Credits have an expiry period to encourage regular usage rather than hoarding. On Tangle Mainnet, you can accumulate credits for up to one week from your last claim. After one week, your accumulated credits reset to zero and you start earning fresh credits again.

This system encourages users to actively claim and use their credits rather than letting them pile up indefinitely.

### Claiming Process

To claim credits, you submit a transaction with your GitHub account as the off-chain ID. The system calculates how many credits you've earned based on your stake, verifies this amount, and emits an event that credits the specified amount to your GitHub account on ai.tangle.tools.
