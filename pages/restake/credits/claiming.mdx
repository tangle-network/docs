# How to Claim Credits

This guide walks you through the process of claiming your earned credits from TNT staking through the Cloud Credits pallet.

## Prerequisites

- **Active TNT Stake**: You must have TNT staked through Tangle's multi-asset delegation system
- **Minimum Stake**: Your stake must meet the lowest tier threshold to earn credits
- **Off-chain Account**: An identifier linking your claim to off-chain credit management

## Claiming via Polkadot.js Apps

### Step 1: Connect to Tangle Network

1. Go to [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps)
2. Connect to the Tangle Network endpoint
3. Import or connect your account with TNT stake

### Step 2: Navigate to Extrinsics

1. Go to **Developer** → **Extrinsics**
2. Select your account from the dropdown
3. Choose `cloudCredits` from the pallet list
4. Select `claimCredits` from the call dropdown

### Step 3: Fill Parameters

**Amount to Claim (`amount_to_claim`):**

- Enter the number of credits you want to claim
- Must not exceed your accrued amount within the claim window
- Use the RPC query (see below) to check your maximum claimable amount

**Off-chain Account ID (`offchain_account_id`):**

- Your identifier for linking to off-chain credit systems
- Maximum length is configurable (check pallet constants)
- Keep this consistent across claims

### Step 4: Submit Transaction

1. Click **Submit Transaction**
2. Enter your password if prompted
3. Confirm the transaction
4. Monitor the transaction status in the **Network** → **Explorer**

## Alternative: Asset-Specific Claims

For claiming credits from specific asset stakes:

1. Choose `claimCreditsWithAsset` instead of `claimCredits`
2. Add the **Asset ID** parameter for the specific asset
3. The same amount and off-chain account ID rules apply

}
```
