# How to Claim Credits

This guide walks you through the process of claiming your earned credits from TNT staking through the Cloud Credits pallet.

## Understanding the System

### How Credit Claiming Works

The Cloud Credits pallet tracks **potential credits** earned through TNT staking. When you claim:

1. **Calculation**: The pallet calculates credits accrued within the claim window
2. **Verification**: It verifies your requested amount doesn't exceed the calculated maximum
3. **Event Emission**: A `CreditsClaimed` event is emitted for off-chain processing
4. **No On-Chain Balance**: No actual tokens are transferred - this is purely event-based

### Claim Window System

- Credits accrue within a configurable time window (`ClaimWindowBlocks`)
- Only credits earned within the current window can be claimed
- Regular claiming prevents losing potential credits from window expiration

## Prerequisites

- **Active TNT Stake**: You must have TNT staked through Tangle's multi-asset delegation system
- **Minimum Stake**: Your stake must meet the lowest tier threshold to earn credits
- **Off-chain Account**: An identifier linking your claim to off-chain credit management

## Claiming via Polkadot.js Apps

### Step 1: Connect to Tangle Network

1. Go to [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps)
2. Connect to the Tangle Network endpoint
3. Import or connect your account with TNT stake

### Step 2: Navigate to Extrinsics

1. Go to **Developer** → **Extrinsics**
2. Select your account from the dropdown
3. Choose `cloudCredits` from the pallet list
4. Select `claimCredits` from the call dropdown

### Step 3: Fill Parameters

**Amount to Claim (`amount_to_claim`):**

- Enter the number of credits you want to claim
- Must not exceed your accrued amount within the claim window
- Use the RPC query (see below) to check your maximum claimable amount

**Off-chain Account ID (`offchain_account_id`):**

- Your identifier for linking to off-chain credit systems
- Maximum length is configurable (check pallet constants)
- Keep this consistent across claims

### Step 4: Submit Transaction

1. Click **Submit Transaction**
2. Enter your password if prompted
3. Confirm the transaction
4. Monitor the transaction status in the **Network** → **Explorer**

## Alternative: Asset-Specific Claims

For claiming credits from specific asset stakes:

1. Choose `claimCreditsWithAsset` instead of `claimCredits`
2. Add the **Asset ID** parameter for the specific asset
3. The same amount and off-chain account ID rules apply

## Understanding Stake Tiers

Credit emission rates depend on your stake tier:

### Tier System

- Higher stakes unlock higher emission rates per block
- Tiers are configured during genesis with thresholds and rates
- The pallet uses the highest tier your stake qualifies for

### Example Calculation

```
If you stake 50,000 TNT and qualify for Tier 2 (1.0 credits/block):
- Claim window: 7200 blocks (24 hours)
- Last claim: 3600 blocks ago
- Claimable credits: 3600 blocks × 1.0 = 3,600 credits
```

## Checking Accrued Credits

### Using RPC Queries

Before claiming, check your accrued amount:

1. Go to **Developer** → **RPC calls**
2. Select the appropriate RPC method
3. Enter your account ID
4. Optionally specify a block number

This shows your maximum claimable amount without submitting a transaction.

## Events and Monitoring

### CreditsClaimed Event

When you successfully claim:

```
CreditsClaimed {
    who: Your_Account_ID,
    amount_claimed: Claimed_Amount,
    offchain_account_id: Your_Offchain_ID
}
```

### CreditsGrantedFromBurn Event

When you burn TNT:

```
CreditsGrantedFromBurn {
    who: Your_Account_ID,
    tnt_burned: Burned_Amount,
    credits_granted: Calculated_Credits
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

**`ClaimAmountExceedsWindowAllowance`**

- You're trying to claim more than your accrued amount
- Check your actual accrued credits using RPC queries
- Reduce the claim amount to within the calculated limit

**`InvalidClaimId`**

- Your off-chain account ID exceeds the maximum length
- Check the `MaxOffchainAccountIdLength` constant
- Use a shorter identifier

**`NoValidTier`**

- Your stake is below the minimum tier threshold
- Increase your TNT stake to qualify for credit accrual
- Check current tier configuration

**`AmountZero`**

- You entered zero for the amount
- Specify a positive amount to claim or burn

**`InsufficientTntBalance`**

- You don't have enough TNT to burn
- Check your free balance before burning
