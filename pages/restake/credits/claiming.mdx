# How to Claim Credits

This guide walks you through the process of claiming your earned Tangle Credits.

## Prerequisites

- Active TNT stake through the multi-asset delegation system
- Accumulated credits from staking or burning
- Off-chain account identifier for credit delivery

## Claiming via Tangle dApp

### Step 1: Check Available Credits

1. Navigate to the Credits section in the Tangle dApp
2. Connect your wallet
3. View your available credits balance
4. Check your credit accrual rate based on current stake

### Step 2: Initiate Claim

1. Click "Claim Credits"
2. Enter the amount of credits to claim
3. Provide your off-chain account ID
4. Review the transaction details

### Step 3: Confirm Transaction

1. Approve the transaction in your wallet
2. Wait for blockchain confirmation
3. Monitor the transaction status

### Step 4: Verify Credit Receipt

1. Check your off-chain account for credited amount
2. Credits should appear within minutes of confirmation
3. Contact support if credits don't appear within 24 hours

## Claiming via Polkadot.js

### Step 1: Navigate to Extrinsics

1. Open Polkadot.js Apps
2. Go to Developer > Extrinsics
3. Select your account

### Step 2: Submit Claim

1. Select `credits` pallet
2. Choose `claimCredits` extrinsic
3. Enter parameters:
   - `amount`: Credits to claim
   - `offchainAccountId`: Your off-chain identifier
4. Submit transaction

### Step 3: Monitor Events

1. Go to Network > Explorer
2. Find your transaction
3. Verify `CreditsClaimed` event emission

## Claiming via Command Line

Using the Tangle CLI:

```bash
tangle credits claim \
  --amount 1000 \
  --offchain-account "your-account-id" \
  --account YOUR_ADDRESS
```

## Best Practices

### Optimal Claiming Frequency

- **Weekly claims**: Balance between gas costs and credit availability
- **Monthly claims**: Minimize transaction fees
- **Before unstaking**: Claim all available credits

### Maximizing Credit Accrual

1. **Maintain consistent stake**: Avoid frequent stake changes
2. **Choose appropriate tier**: Stake enough to reach efficient tiers
3. **Monitor tier changes**: Adjust stake when tiers update

### Security Considerations

- **Verify off-chain account**: Double-check account ID before claiming
- **Use secure connections**: Always use official dApps and tools
- **Keep records**: Track claims for accounting purposes

## Troubleshooting

### Credits Not Showing

If your credits aren't appearing:

1. **Check stake status**: Ensure your TNT is properly staked
2. **Verify time elapsed**: Credits accrue over time
3. **Review tier requirements**: Confirm you meet minimum stake

### Failed Claims

Common reasons for failed claims:

- **Insufficient credits**: Try claiming a smaller amount
- **Invalid account ID**: Verify off-chain account format
- **Network congestion**: Retry with higher gas fees

### Calculation Discrepancies

If calculated credits don't match expectations:

- **Check current tier**: Tiers may have been updated
- **Review stake changes**: Recent changes affect accrual
- **Consider time windows**: Accrual may be capped

## Technical Details

### Credit Calculation Formula

```
Credits = Staked_Amount × Rate_Per_Block × Blocks_Elapsed
```

Where:
- `Staked_Amount`: Your current TNT stake
- `Rate_Per_Block`: Tier-based emission rate
- `Blocks_Elapsed`: Blocks since last claim (capped)

### Event Structure

The `CreditsClaimed` event contains:
```rust
{
  account: AccountId,
  amount: Balance,
  offchain_account_id: Vec<u8>
}
```
