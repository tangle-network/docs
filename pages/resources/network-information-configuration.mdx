# Getting Started with Tangle Network

## Networks in the Tangle Ecosystem

Before you dive into development, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with the different networks within the Tangle ecosystem.

## Types for Chain Integration

To find the latest types for Tangle Network, [visit the lookup.tsx file in our Github repo.](https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/blob/main/types/src/interfaces/lookup.ts) It automatically produces a full file of the types for the network on changes.

## Block Explorers

We will offer two types of block explorers to accommodate the Ethereum API and Substrate API. Transactions based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can be accessed through the Ethereum API. Conversely, the Substrate API is your go-to for native Substrate operations such as governance and staking. While the Substrate API does provide some details about EVM-based transactions, the information it presents is somewhat limited.

| Block Explorer | Type      | URL                                                                                |

## Development Tools

As an Ethereum-compatible, Substrate-based chain, Tangle Network allows for the use of both Substrate and Ethereum tools.
