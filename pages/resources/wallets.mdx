# Tangle Network Wallets

## Overview

The Tangle Network is a versatile blockchain that integrates both Substrate and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) functionalities, offering a wide range of features and compatibility with numerous wallets. This document outlines the wallets available for use on the Tangle Network, including details for both the Substrate and EVM sides of the network.

### Wallets for Substrate Functionality

The Substrate side of the Tangle Network supports the following wallets:

- **Subwallet**: A comprehensive wallet solution designed specifically for Substrate-based networks. Users can manage their assets, interact with DApps, and more. [Download from Subwallet.](https://www.subwallet.app/download.html)
- **Polkadot.js Extension**: A browser extension that allows users to interact with Substrate-based networks directly from their browser. It's convenient for managing accounts and performing transactions on the Tangle Network. [Download from polkadot.js.org.](https://polkadot.js.org/)
- **Talisman Wallet**: While full integration is in progress, users can currently claim their airdrop using the Talisman wallet. Stay tuned for full functionality updates. [Download from Talisman.xyz](https://www.talisman.xyz/)
