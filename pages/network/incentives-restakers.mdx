# Restaking Incentives for Depositors

## Overview

Tangle Network incentivizes restakers through TNT rewards for depositing specific assets. These rewards are distributed at regular intervals defined by governance (approximately every 7 days). The protocol determines which assets are incentivized and their maximum deposit capacities through governance decisions.

## Deposit Mechanics

### Deposit Capacity

The system implements maximum deposit capacities for each incentivized asset to ensure secure and controlled TVL growth. Key aspects:

- Fixed maximum amount per asset
- APY distributed proportionally to deposits/capacity ratio
- Unallocated APY is never minted
- APY defines reward allocation at full capacity

### Protocol Implementation

The `pallet-multi-asset-delegation` system manages:

- Deposit and withdrawal logic
- Delegation to operators
- Asset staking mechanisms
- APY and capacity configurations
- System upgrades via governance

Users can view available assets and their parameters through the Tangle Restaking dApp.

### Withdrawal Process

- Standard withdrawal delay: ~7 days (W sessions)
- Deposits continue earning incentives during withdrawal period
- Assets must be unstaked before withdrawal

## Scoring and Rewards

### Score Distribution

The protocol uses a scoring mechanism to allocate rewards:

- Base score: 1 point per token unit
- Independent scoring per incentivized asset
- Pro-rata distribution based on user scores
- On-chain calculation at each reward interval

### Lock Multipliers

Users can enhance their score through time-locks:

- Longer locks = higher score multiplier
- Locked tokens cannot be withdrawn until expiry
- Multiplier directly impacts reward share

### Reward Calculation

The reward formula at any point is:

R = APY × (User Score / Total Asset Score) × (Total Asset Deposited / Deposit Capacity)

Where:

- $X\%$ = Asset's APY
- USER_SCORE = User's locked deposit score
- TOTAL_SCORE_OF_ASSET = Sum of all user scores for the asset
- TOTAL_ASSET_DEPOSITED = Total amount deposited
- DEPOSIT_CAPACITY = Maximum deposit capacity

## Example Scenario

Consider WETH with:

- 1% TNT inflation allocation
- 1,000 WETH deposit cap
- Base score: 1 per WETH

If Alice locks 10 WETH for 12 months:

- Score = 10 × 12 = 120 points
- Reward calculation:
  ```
  1% × (120/TOTAL_SCORE_OF_WETH) × (TOTAL_WETH_DEPOSITED/1000)
  ```

> **Note:** Actual rewards fluctuate based on total deposits and lock durations in the system.
