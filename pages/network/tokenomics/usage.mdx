# TNT Token Information and Utility

The Tangle Network's native token is TNT, critical for the capabilities in Zero-Knowledge (ZK) and Multiparty Computation (MPC) as-a-service. TNT also underpins the entire ecosystem's operation and governance.

| Network        | Network Type | Native Asset Symbol | Native Asset Decimals |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Tangle Network | Mainnet      | TNT                 | 18                    |
| Tangle Testnet | Testnet      | tTNT                | 18                    |

## Usage Cases

### Consensus Mechanism and nPoS:

The Tangle Network's nominated proof-of-stake (nPoS) consensus mechanism requires TNT to be staked by validators to participate in validating blocks. Additionally, nominators can nominate their TNT to individual validators to participate in the rewards to that validator and increase that validator's tokens-at-stake.

### Network Economics

Tangle Network dynamically mints or burns TNT tokens to reward consensus protocol participants like validators and nominators, partially fund its treasury, manage inflation, and ensure the network's economic stability.

### ZK and MPC Operations

TNT serves as the currency for transactions between job submitters and validators within the Tangle Network's ZK and MPC services. This facilitates seamless, secure, and efficient execution of complex computations and privacy-preserving operations.

### Validator Restaking:

Validators are required to restake TNT tokens to maintain their role in performing ZK and MPC services. This mechanism promotes ongoing commitment and participation in the network's core functionalities.

### Slashing Mechanisms:

To safeguard against malicious activities, TNT tokens are integral to Tangle's slashing protocols across consensus and the restaking system. These measures are designed to deter attacks and incentivize adherence to network protocols.

### Governance Empowerment:

TNT holders wield governance power, enabling them to partake in pivotal network decisions through referenda. This democratic approach ensures that the Tangle Network evolves in alignment with its community's interests.

---

A considerable portion of TNT will be actively engaged in the network, either staked by validators and nominators for network security or utilized in the execution of ZK and MPC tasks. This not only ensures the network's resilience and security but also drives engagement and utility within the Tangle ecosystem.
