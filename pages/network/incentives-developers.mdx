# Developer Incentives

Tangle Network provides developers with automated revenue streams through blueprint deployment and usage. When users instance your blueprints, smart contracts automatically distribute fees according to a fixed model: 50% to you as the developer, 30% to operators and restakers via Boosted TNT, and 20% to the protocol treasury.

## Core Revenue Mechanisms

### Direct Blueprint Revenue

- Earn 50% of all instance fees automatically
- Control your revenue share through EVM-based distribution logic
- Implement custom tokenization and revenue-sharing models
- Configure automated payment collection and distribution

### Whitelisting Benefits

Blueprints demonstrating high utility can access additional revenue through whitelisting:

- Receive protocol inflation rewards
- Gain enhanced network visibility
- Qualification based on metrics like active instances, transaction volume, and security capital

## Technical Integration

Your blueprint automatically inherits Tangle's security infrastructure:

- TNT-based restaking mechanism
- Native LST support
- Configurable security parameters
- Smart contract-based revenue distribution

## Economic Dynamics

Successful blueprints benefit from natural market forces:

- Higher usage â†’ increased instance fees
- Utility drives restaking capital allocation
- Operator registration follows valuable blueprints
- Self-reinforcing cycle of adoption and security

## Implementation

1. Deploy your blueprint (open or closed source)
2. Set revenue distribution parameters
3. Monitor usage and metrics
4. Optionally pursue whitelisting for additional benefits

The system is designed to let you focus on building valuable software while the network handles monetization, security, and distribution infrastructure.
