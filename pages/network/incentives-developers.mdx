# Developer Incentives

## Overview

Tangle Network provides compelling incentives for developers to build and deploy Blueprints - reusable templates for monetizable software services. The platform enables developers to earn ongoing revenue from their innovations through service fees, protocol rewards, and customizable incentive mechanisms.

## Blueprint Development Benefits

### Revenue Sharing Model

When customers instantiate and use Blueprint services, the generated revenue is distributed as follows:

- **50%** - Blueprint Developer
- **30%** - Operators/Restakers via Boosted TNT Mechanism
- **20%** - Protocol Treasury

This model ensures developers capture significant value from their Blueprint's long-term usage while maintaining flexibility in incentive design.

### Programmable Distribution

Developers have full control over their 30% programmable distribution tranche, enabling:

- Custom token creation where holders earn revenue share
- Deployment subsidies to encourage service adoption
- Additional operator rewards to attract quality providers
- Smart contract-based distribution logic using the EVM

### Incentivized Blueprint Program

High-value Blueprints can qualify for additional protocol incentives through the whitelisting process. Selection criteria includes:

- Revenue generation from instances
- Transaction and job volume
- Operator participation
- Total restaked security capital

Whitelisted Blueprints receive enhanced visibility and protocol rewards, creating healthy competition among developers.

## Technical Implementation

### Default Asset Requirements

- TNT is the mandatory base restaking asset for all Blueprint instances
- Native TNT liquid staking tokens (LSTs) are automatically supported
- Customers can add other approved assets for additional security

### Payment Customization

Developers can:

- Configure payment addresses for revenue distribution
- Build custom smart contracts to manage revenue splits
- Implement flexible reward mechanisms for stakeholders
