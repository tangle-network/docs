# Tangle Network Points System

The Tangle Network introduces a points system, allowing participants to accumulate experience points, also referred to as XP, by engaging in various activities across the ecosystem. This system is designed to recognize contributions and encourage active involvement.

Points earned will directly influence your eligibility for future airdrops, and we will leverage the democracy system to push forward retroactive airdrops for different types of participation from staking and restaking to operating and validating to developing and instancing Blueprints.

## Participation Mechanics: How to Earn Points

Your points are earned through various participation mechanics across Tangle Network. These points reflect your contributions and will determine your rank on the upcoming leaderboard.

**1\. Restaking Participation**

- Deposits: Earn points by depositing whitelisted assets into the restaking system.
- Delegations: Delegate whitelisted assets to operators to earn points.

**2\. Network Participation**

- Staking and Nominating: Stake TNT tokens and nominate validators.
- Liquid Staking: Liquid stake TNT to earn points.

**3\. Network Roles**

- Operators: Register as an operator to earn points. Operate services to earn points.
- Validators: Run a validator to earn points.

**4\. Partner Integrations**

- Partners bringing assets into the network through integrations (e.g., Router Protocol, Hourglass) will earn points when users deposit assets for supporting ecosystem growth.

**5\. Development and Instancing**

- Developers can earn points by innovating. Eligibility for inclusion is determined by:

  - 100% completed innovations, no consideration otherwise.
  - Fully open source on Github.
  - Informative README.
  - Post on Common forum [https://common.xyz/tangle](https://common.xyz/tangle) with blog style post.

- Developers who complete publicly issued bounties from any public Tangle resource will earn points.
- Developers who build innovative Blueprints through hackathons or general interest.
- Developers who deploy Blueprints to testnet and eventually mainnet.
- Developers who get their Blueprints registered for, operated on, and instanced.
- Customers who instance Blueprints.

### To Maximize Your Points:

- **Diversify Activities:** Engage in multiple areas—restaking, nominating, running operators or validators, and social engagement—to maximize your point accumulation.
- **Stay Consistent:** Participate for as long as possible to ensure continuous accrual of points.

### How Points Work

- All eligible activities are recorded, and corresponding points are awarded.
- Points continue to accumulate for ongoing actions such as staking or delegating.
- Rankings will be reflected on the Tangle Leaderboard once it goes live.
- Points for different actions may be considered for different tranches of future airdrops.

## Tangle Leaderboard (Coming Soon)

The **Tangle Leaderboard** will rank participants based on their total points earned. This ranking system is designed to showcase top contributors and foster healthy competition within the ecosystem.

#### What to Expect

1. Participants will be ranked in descending order based on their cumulative points.
2. Your rank will depend on the points you earn, which are influenced by the variety of activities you participate in and the duration of your engagement in each activity.

Stay tuned for updates regarding when the leaderboard goes live\!
